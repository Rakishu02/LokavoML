The place is cozy, with tables and chairs that dont look too messy at all, making the atmosphere more homey and warm. You can choose a small hangout table if youre just drinking, or a sofa table, or a wooden table for the family. The location is on the ground level of the Novotel YIA, so those who are bored of the typical hotel restaurant atmosphere can really hang out here, especially if you like books and board games because here they provide quite a lot of books to read. Mostly romance & Mira W, but there is also Paulo Coelho, and architecture magazines, and... Sentaro & Hai Miiko comics. The reading choice is a bit absurd, I know, but I think this is a private collection that owns a cafe and I just enjoy looking at any book lol. For those who want to hang out while charging their gadgets, plugs are also available on all the tables attached to the wall. The service is okay, the staff are friendly too. Its a shame that many of the menus arent available, but maybe because I went there during Eid, there was beef at the market after being brushed by mothers to cook rendang, maybe. Buy me a special curry noodle which turns out to be, hmm, just Indomie with cheese added (I think). Its actually delicious, its not a problem, the curry is delicious and the sauce is creamy, the topping is boiled egg and fried onions, actually its not a problem because its for dinner, its not heavy either. With a price of 35k for the size of a hotel cafe it still comes in, we all know were not paying for the food only here. Unfortunately I didnt have time to try other dishes and cakes, maybe next time. He also provides several kinds of beer, and the funny thing is there is locally produced canned kombucha. Try the kawista flavored one, its really delicious, fresh, tangy tamarind, adding ice to the glass makes your eyes open, for those who are bored of standard cafe drinks, you can try this.",1,1.0

For food, there were only 2 dishes served out of the 5 orders I requested. I dont know if it was because there were a lot of guests or the wait staff was slow to respond, even though I noticed that the guests at the table behind me arrived later, but their beefsteak had already been delivered to their table, while I was not delivered earlier. Because my husband and I had an appointment with a client, we decided to take it before the restaurant closed. For the fried rice, I rated it at 8, but for the sapo tofu, it was 6 because it was too salty. For very cheap restaurant-class prices.

Came at 4 pm, Tuesday, there were only 2 visitors, then when they finished I was alone until 7 oclock. This time I ordered Sambosa, Stir-fried Acehnese Noodles, Hot Lemongrass Tea, Shaved Cucumber Ice. All delicious. The original lemongrass tea is made from lemongrass soaked in water, not powder. Shaved Cucumber Ice tastes just right, not too sweet. Fresh! Sambosa is delicious, 3 servings will fill you up alone. The Mie Aceh Stir-fry is delicious but not special because I have tried Mie Aceh which has a more pronounced taste and aroma of spices, but this is really enough for me who has a craving for warm, soupy and spicy food. Its just right, not too salty. Im really happy with my main goal, which is to work here and it happens to be quiet. Judging by the space is very intimate, I would call it, actually this is not an ideal place to work, especially for calls or meetings because the sound will leak to the surroundings, but it is really worth a visit Will be back to try Shawarma and Nasi Mandhi here. --- Santorini vibes but Middle Eastern flavors. I didnt intend to come here but when I passed by I was attracted to the front door so I went in, haha. A proof of thoughtful design, color or concept can make people take action ;) Just order Arayes and Americano, and be satisfied! Arayes are like pizza or martabak, thin and dry but taste like kebabs. Unfortunately, the sambae is not good enough. Yes, even though it looks like bottled chili sauce, there are things that taste better. Or maybe you can serve it with mayonnaise, tartar sauce, or other types of tamarind sauce so the taste is more balanced in the mouth. The Americano is delicious. My kinda type of black coffee; not sour, a little bitter, but the coffee tastes good. Love The table settings vary, not all of them are comfortable for eating or working on a laptop because there are tables that are knee high. Meanwhile, the tall table doesnt have a large capacity.",1,1.0

Beefless lasagna : 8/10. Not too creamy with authentic tomato sauce. Good. Truffle Mushroom pasta : 8/10. Its delicious but unfortunately the truffle taste is lacking. Maybe you can add more to make it even better. Burgreen beefless steak: 8.5/10. This is my son eating. And this is delicious, said my son who loves steak. Vegan rendang bowl: 8.5/10 according to those who eat well. It fits his tongue. Excellent. Vegan Rica meat: 9.5/10. I forgot what the name of the menu is, but this is really delicious... The Rica red chili sauce stir-fried with the meat is really delicious. Those who want to go there must try this menu. Very suitable for the tongue of Indonesian people like me. Matcha Latte bobba: 8/10 delicious and fresh. The matcha tastes good Brother Max Boba Iced Milk Coffee: 8/10. The coffee is delicious on a friendly stomach. Brown sugar milky Boba: 8/10 not too milky because they use soy milk but its delicious. My son likes it. Raw strawberry cheesecake : 8.5/10. Delicious... Fresh asem2, tastes like real cheesecake. Kids friendly... So its really safe to bring your kids here, there are lots of menus that kids can eat. Kid-friendliness: The place is comfortable for eating with children. Its very good to bring your children here, for children who rarely eat plant based food you can come here because here the plants are transformed into something they will definitely like. Hehehe",1,0.0

For the room, we were treated to all white paint. The layout of the room is very neat and very detailed. The cables in the cashiers room are very neatly arranged for me, which is a plus which is very rarely found in other cafes. As for the menu in the snack section, I also like it, he explained that if you order cireng, for example, it contains 4, mendoan contains 5, for example, something like that. Thats really good, so those of us who want to order it wont be confused about how much this snack contains, right? As for the menu, I ordered the one in the picture and the taste exceeded my expectations. The seasoning for the fried and grilled chicken really penetrated the chicken perfectly, theres no such thing as tough meat either. The sauce is also delicious, but sorry if you like it spicy, dont expect more. Maybe this is the problem. Recommendation so that everyone can taste the ayam penyet from parents, young people, children from the age of 10 can also eat it. The recommendation is that if you like coffee, you can order V60 Robusta, the coffee is delicious even if you mix it with ice, sometimes if you mix it with ice it actually tastes bland, but not this one, the bitterness is strong, especially if you have left a little of it, the original beeh is delicious. I also ordered squeezed orange ice, it wasnt sweet, it wasnt sour either, it was just fresh. For the employees, they are super friendly, 10 stars if there are any, every time they deliver food they are asked if there is enough or not, they are really friendly. Come here at night so the lights are really good. There is a bathroom, prayer room, sink, there is an aesthetic mirror too, there is an upstairs, special chairs for children. The facilities are complete, nice, aesthetic, comfortable, cool too because the place is also on the edge of the rice fields. Recommended for gatherings with friends, family/couple. The downside is that I also ordered melted bananas, the skin was thick so it was difficult to cut, the nails also used quite a lot of effort, haha. But I was still satisfied because the chocolate really melted in my mouth. But I still have to improve it The price of food/drinks is cheap because you get a nice place, friendly service and you should be really satisfied. Happy weekend",1,0.0
