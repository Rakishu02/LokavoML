Even though all you can eat as much meat as you like, you cant just request meat.. they say the package is like that, its not possible even though its all you can eat.. Because I dont like chicken, I only asked once so I was disappointed.. 3. The usual all you can eat meat with sweet marinade is not suitable because the taste is more salty, there is black pepper and onion 4. And when I went there it was 17.45 -18. The 30 desserts only include delicious fried dumplings, delicious cuangki, so dont try it because its already watery, and delicious iced yogurt, for drinking lemon tea and delicious orange flavor. Its just that there arent any other variations like the reviews of other friends like theres porridge or sauce. 5. For Tomyan, I didnt try it because I dont like Tomyan.

Even though the price has now changed to just 7 thousand, the taste is also not satisfactory, aka BITTER!!!! The color of the flour is brownish, not golden, for those who dont know, other people will say that yesterday it didnt sell well when fried again, but actually its because they used baking soda. Yup, if you use too much baking soda, it will taste and smell bitter. So its better to just buy roadside fred ciken and the price is the same. Or add 500 and get the dokeh brand.",0,1.0

Then I went there, at the first impression, its wasnt a good place to sit and open your laptop to do some works. I saw few people from outside, the place was not crowded. I thought it was a specialty coffee shop, but when I order japanese, it wasnt available. Theres not many choices of coffee available here. The air conditioned room was also full of smokes haze and some people playing game projected in to a big screen. The outdoor area wasnt comfortable and the lighting was also dimly lit.

Order somay wonton noodles, meatballs and iceberg. The taste of the noodles is bland, the soup is the same. Plus the chili sauce doesnt really help either. Not suitable for me. In contrast to noodles, the meatball sauce is very salty. The meatballs are quite delicious, large in size. For mountain ice its like stoned ice. The taste is quite unique, there are so many kinds of fillings. There are only a few that I think are not suitable for ice filling. Cont: snake fruit and apples comfortable place, not too spacious. Quite busy at lunch time. Somay wonton noodles: 17k Meatballs: 25k (1 pc) fried food, small pentol : 3k (1 pc) Iceberg : 15k Overall 3/5, Im not satisfied.",0,1.0
