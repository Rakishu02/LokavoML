Register for the digital menu by scanning the QR code and order via the website. There are so many menus that youre confused about which one to choose For the main course, I finally ordered Kuey Teow Siram Chicken Shrimp, which in my opinion is more suitable to be called kwetiau soup. For dessert, STRAWBERRY CHEESE SUNDAY is quite recommended. The combination of sweet, sour and slightly savory flavors, plus the combination of the soft texture of the ice cream and the crunchy corn flakes, really pampers the tongue. Suitable as a topping for white sugar croffles. Price? Slightly pricey. But its commensurate with the comfort of the place which makes you feel at home hanging out here.",1

Initially starting with the concept of take away using an ojol, I didnt expect that now you can dine-in in a restaurant as cool as this. In my opinion, the restaurant is very comfortable, there is an indoor area which I think is spacious and an outdoor area which is no less spacious. The indoor AC is also cold and the service is recommended, especially the lady who wears a headscarf. If you order a package, all the condiments (Nasi Jangkep) are available, a small plate of fried noodles, satay lilit, matah-kecombrang chili sauce, lawar, egg and betutu sauce. Then the main side dishes are: 1. Taliwang Chicken There is a warning sign about the spiciness, when we tried it, it tasted spicy and very spicy, the pieces were big and also juicy. 2. Sluggish Chicken This is a chefs recommendation sign. The taste is spicy-sweet and very tasty, this is shredded chicken and the color is really red, it makes you want to eat. After that, there are a few tips for using shrimp paste or ebi. Not sure either. 3. Lemongrass Honey Tea This is sweet tea with honey and a slice of lemon. In my opinion, the lemongrass needs to be crushed to make it fresher, its not just the smell thats fresh. 3. Ice Balinese Kuwut This is basically using coconut water, adding melon syrup, basil seeds and nata de coco as well as cucumber and lime shavings. While waiting for the food to arrive, we got a complimentary dish, namely a small bowl of Rambak and then we were also given cutlery that had been sterilized with hot water. In conclusion, in my opinion, this is highly recommended. The total price paid wasnt much, only 140 thousand but it was really filling. Good service, cleanliness and atmosphere, everything is also okay.",1

But, lucky luck, yesterday the discount was IDR 588,023 for two. You could say its just IDR 294,011 for one person hihi For that package I got the types of meat: Coracao, Frango, Smoked beef Sausage, Garlic Steak, Wagyu saikoro, sweet and spicy Jalapeno, Picanha, Cupim, Oyster Blade, Ribeye, Grilled Pineapple The taste doesnt betray the price, although there are some things I dont like. But overall its all delicious My favorites: 1. Grilled Pineapple (this is the tastiest among the Brazilian BBQ Ive ever tried, the sweet taste is really right and its really a real favorite, always order 7 slices more   ) 2. Smoked beef sausage (to be honest, when I came here for the first time, I actually didnt like their sausage, but after coming here a few times, the taste is different. Its better, I think theyve upgraded) 3. Cheese bread (this is really next level cheese bread, always order 5 pcs   ) 4. Coracao 5. Picanha 6. Wagyu saikoro (this is actually a favorite, but I dont know, when I came here yesterday it tasted a little different, but I still want to add it to my favorite because it was delicious when I ate it before) 7. Garlic steak So far, I think the food here is delicious. There are just a few that dont feel consistent. The buffet is also delicious but the fried food doesnt quite fit my mouth. And whats more, mushroom soup sometimes changes its taste, if you go there it will definitely taste delicious. But, there have also been times when Ive felt that its not good. Its true that the PR isnt consistent enough. But, overall its delicious",1

Came at 4 pm, Tuesday, there were only 2 visitors, then when they finished I was alone until 7 oclock. This time I ordered Sambosa, Stir-fried Acehnese Noodles, Hot Lemongrass Tea, Shaved Cucumber Ice. All delicious. The original lemongrass tea is made from lemongrass soaked in water, not powder. Shaved Cucumber Ice tastes just right, not too sweet. Fresh! Sambosa is delicious, 3 servings will fill you up alone. The Mie Aceh Stir-fry is delicious but not special because I have tried Mie Aceh which has a more pronounced taste and aroma of spices, but this is really enough for me who has a craving for warm, soupy and spicy food. Its just right, not too salty. Im really happy with my main goal, which is to work here and it happens to be quiet. Judging by the space is very intimate, I would call it, actually this is not an ideal place to work, especially for calls or meetings because the sound will leak to the surroundings, but it is really worth a visit Will be back to try Shawarma and Nasi Mandhi here. --- Santorini vibes but Middle Eastern flavors. I didnt intend to come here but when I passed by I was attracted to the front door so I went in, haha. A proof of thoughtful design, color or concept can make people take action ;) Just order Arayes and Americano, and be satisfied! Arayes are like pizza or martabak, thin and dry but taste like kebabs. Unfortunately, the sambae is not good enough. Yes, even though it looks like bottled chili sauce, there are things that taste better. Or maybe you can serve it with mayonnaise, tartar sauce, or other types of tamarind sauce so the taste is more balanced in the mouth. The Americano is delicious. My kinda type of black coffee; not sour, a little bitter, but the coffee tastes good. Love The table settings vary, not all of them are comfortable for eating or working on a laptop because there are tables that are knee high. Meanwhile, the tall table doesnt have a large capacity.",1

Unfortunately its not yet available on Grabfood. The place is in the shophouses to the left of the road from the intersection if you are coming from Jalan Ki Mangunsarkoro which seems to be uphill, next to Jeje Bag. The price for 1 cup of selsel is quite affordable, around IDR 14,000, the packaging uses a cup sealer so it will be prone to spilling if we buy it to take away. Coincidentally, when I went there, not all variants were ready, only a few were ready. In 1 cup of selsel, the topping will be given a layer of cream cheese and the bottom will have bubbles, and the middle will be given milk and green tea (I happened to order the green tea flavor). Unfortunately, when I tried to suck out the bubbles using a straw, the bubbles got stuck in the straw. After trying Selsel I didnt feel disappointed, the taste suits my taste buds, its on my list of favorite Thai teas. The service is friendly and there is no need to wait, if you want to enjoy selsel on the spot, the place is comfortable, there are wooden chairs and long benches with foam and pillows. Maybe you can add snacks instead of just Thai tea.",1

These cayenne peppers are small, from the front, even though they are small, it turns out that inside there is space to sit, not just takeaway only. The ambience is also nice and its really fitting for us to come here in the afternoon so its not too hot either. From the front it is certainly quite eye-catching with white walls and a Santorini-style entrance. Because I just wanted to play for fun, I ordered regal milk, because my stomach couldnt compromise. But the regal milk is delicious, the price is also very affordable. Not bad, next time maybe Ill try the coffee. The service is quite friendly and fast and also makes the menu. The facilities are also pretty good, there are plug sockets plus an indoor area too.",1

Tempatnya nyaman, luas, dan bersih. First timer to be here dan langsung disaranin untuk nyoba Heng Heng Katong Laksa. It is marvelously delicious! Probably the most authentic laksa I ever tasted so far. Selain laksa, ada juga menu2 khas lainnya yang siap untuk dicoba dan tidak akan mengecewakan  . Terus sempet nyoba juga Pizza Plate-nya yang seukuran lebi besar dari telapak tangan. Enak juga dan puas banget intinya kalo nyari2 tempat meeting sambi makan dan minum. Untuk kopinya, di sini ada Toko Kopi Djawa  . Uda ngga usah diragukan yah kenikmatannya. Ngga usah mikir kopinya ada afiliasi sama Isril ato kaga karena ini kopi lokal, ngga kaya toko sebelah  . Alright, oke. Trus apalagi yah. Di sini ada Gelato, ayam Korea, trus ada soto juga, dan ada tukang cukur juga di lantai atas. Cuma sayangnya si Gelato keknya baru beroperasi tu di jam siang ke sore. Jadi kalo mo ke sini dan nikmatin semua makanan dan minuman yg ada di sini, bisa dicoba antara waktu siang ke sore yah. Tapi kalo dari pagi, uda ada tapi terbatas aja pelayanannya. Uda gitu aja. Untuk para pengunjung, tolong tetep jaga kebersihan dan mind your tone of voice yah. Jangan terlalu berisik, hormati kehadiran pengunjung lain, dan tetap jaga communal space ini sebagai tempat sosial dengan tata krama yang sepantasnya di tempat publik. Bukan tempat untuk anak2 dan secara keamanan juga ngga kids friendly dan family friendly. Tempat ini lebi cocok untuk meeting kolega dan kerja WFA.",1

It came out with a salad and a side dish of potato that you can choose, we ordered mashed potato which was a huge mistake because the brisket was so tender, and when it met the soft mashed potato, it lost its perfectness, a bit   should ve had fries or wedges instead (BUT we did ask for wedges, but it was sold out for the night). The carbonara pasta was a comfort food, they put plenty of beef bacon, and mushroom yet the sauce was good but too watery for me, I wish it could be thicker and creamier and a bit savory. The highlights, other than the brisket, which should ve had the crispy side dishes instead tho lol, were the drinks   berry blast & Hello Honje! I believe they also have a new menu of this cold-pressed juice that I brought home 3 bottles of them to try out.

Also open in the afternoon starting at 4pm. There are lots of places to sit, but at the bottom (under the canopy) there are several tables that were exposed to rainwater. There are toilets and prayer rooms, but it is recommended to bring your own mukenah + prayer room, the ablution area is open so it is not hijab friendly. The location is in a small alley and a little far from the city center. The tea is top notch, Ive been here twice and always order the artisan one. The lady is also very friendly, explaining + answering questions about her tea. They also sell tea but the system is PO. Previously I ordered the artisan roots, its really unique to drink tea but it smells earthy (in a good way ofc), but not too sweet. This time I ordered chamomile tea (single source), the aroma is really calming and the taste is better than the many branded teas in supermarkets hehe. If you dont use sugar, its already sweet enough. Black tea + sunkiss + white peach is quite sweet, but I still add more sugar because my child really likes sweet. It tastes a bit fruity but not too sour. The snack is cireng and walik tofu, and its delicious. The prices are really friendly, the tea is 25k per pitcher and the snacks are only 15k. What makes you feel at home here is the cat. This Forbidden is so spoiled that he wants to sit on your lap even though he wasnt told to. Isnt it comfortable trying to drink tea while petting cats? Its really an introverts paradise, especially when you come here, the place isnt crowded. Definitely will comeback here.",1

I thought the menu was western, but it turned out to be Chinese food. So far, I really like the ambience of the place. Very aesthetic and vintage, considering it was a former colonial era building. Here, I first tried escargot seasoned with garlic. It tastes good too, chewy when you bite it and the garlic taste is really strong. Apart from that, my version of the mainstay menu here is the eggplant raos. Its really delicious, monangis  I also ordered chicken but forgot the name, this is no less delicious! The chicken is tender and the dipping sauce is just right. This restaurant is really recommended if you want to have a nice meal with your partner or family.",1

Because our car was parked at a slight angle because it was adjusted to the contour conditions of the land in Careuh Coffee. There can be a maximum of 2 cars parked.

The location of the cafe is somewhat hidden in the office area, but the security guard in front of the gate is willing to show you the way to this place. This cafe processes (roasts) its own coffee beans, and almost all of its single origin beans come from Indonesia. I ordered Mentari Senja iced drip coffee (if Im not mistaken, beans from Central Java) whose tropical fruit and winey semwiring character was refreshing on a hot day. My friend, who is not really used to drinking drip coffee, ordered a cappuccino with nutty beans. The food menu is also quite varied, although because of the conversation we chose a menu that can be eaten together - Western platter containing Western fritters and Caesar Salad. Menu prices are a bit expensive, but acceptable for the quality and size of portions offered. A little advice for cafes (if you look at this review), it would also be a good idea to sell coffee not only in the form of beans per package, but in the form of drip sachets which can be used as souvenirs and souvenirs.",1

Here we order: 5/5 Nasik Crab Curry To be honest, I never imagined eating crab cooked with curry spices. I ordered it because its really unique, Ive never seen it anywhere else. When I tried the first bite       oh my gosh, how come youre just eating this delicious food now. So on the plate it is served as follows: White rice Tofu soy sauce Floss Saute the beans Chilli sauce 2pcs rice crackers I think? 1 crab has been split (2 shells, 2 legs and 1 shell) Behind the shell, it turns out its filled with crab meat that has been fried with eggs, I think the crab and eggs are all cooked deep fried (sorry if its sotoy, hahaha). The smell can be delicious, it really smells like eggs combined with the curry sauce. As for the taste of the curry itself, its not the taste of curry in Nasi Padang, its like its a curry fusion, but its really delicious. Its not medok but the taste is just right. If this is a soft shell crab, Im really happy, unfortunately this is a regular crab, its quite big, so cleaning it is a bit of a hassle (the place is so aesthetic, but you have to clean it with your hands, its difficult, bro) 5/5 Tugu Spice Boentoet Rice When I arrived, it was a bit under estimated. The only problem is: Rice Emping A bowl filled with meat and sauce There are no carrots/tomatoes like that and celery is usually there, so the color is good. When I tasted the soup, wow I was so presumptuous I crowned it the BEST oxtail soup Ive ever eaten (sorry again, if thats too much. But its true, what do you think?  ) Its just that if it has carrots and tomatoes, Im happier because Im a vegetable lover. The meat is just right, not a lot of fat and most importantly the sauce is not too spicy, light but just right. How can it be like that?? The place itself: Its like eating in a very old school era The smell of the room is also like the smell of old wood. If youre bored, the atmosphere at a restaurant or mall is just like that. Try it here okay Wait for my arrival, I will come back to try other menus for sure! (Who am I to ask to wait  )",1

When you ask for chili sauce, the waiter says it doesnt exist even though at the dining table the fries + sauce have just arrived. When I asked for sauce, he answered that there was no... I pointed at this sauce (while pointing at the sauce from the potatoes) then he answered, oh, theres not enough sauce Hopefully next time the sauce will be provided on the table and friends.

Found this coffeeshop on the way home, and coincidentally it was raining heavily at that time. And when it rained, I found a coffeeshop that looked serene and attractive from the outside. So I decided to hang out here for a while. . As I said earlier, this coffee shop is small but still comfortable. And it looks pretty good at dusk thanks to the LED lights installed in the outdoor area. Apart from that, the indoor area is also made very bright, so that at night the indoor area can be seen from outside. This coffee shop also doesnt use a lot of decoration, just the neatness of the furniture arrangement is enough to make this coffee shop feel neat. . In terms of capacity, this coffeeshop can accommodate around 20 visitors. And here the facilities are wifi, power socket, parking area, indoor air conditioning and clean toilets. . Talking about the menu, this coffee shop sells various coffees as its specialty menu. Apart from coffee, there are also various teas, chocolate and lattes here. . For food here, there are only snacks such as mentai dim sum, ebi furai, various fries, otak2, etc. . The price range for food and drinks here ranges from 8 thousand to 24 thousand. . Matcha Latte (IDR 20k) Because I was cutting back on coffee, I ordered a matcha latte. In terms of taste, this drink is quite delicious, the matcha taste is quite pronounced in terms of taste and aroma. The sweetness is also just right and made a little, so the matcha taste is more dominant. Overall for this menu, GOOD! Dim Sum Mentai (IDR 24k) Well, because its raining, it feels more delicious if you order something hot, namely dimsum. And I ordered mentai dimsum. In terms of taste, its also quite delicious for me. The dimsum is quite tasty and the chicken in it also tastes good. The doneness is also just right so the texture is very moist and soft. Then the mentai sauce is also delicious, and quite tasty. Overall for this menu, GOOD! Overall I am quite satisfied with this coffeeshop. In terms of taste and quality of food it is very good. In terms of service its also okay, the baristas are quite friendly. And I also like the vibes, its really beautiful. Next time I will come here again.",1

Turns out I fell in love with this place Drinks & Food The menu is quite okay. Not much, but it has its own charm. Because every time I come here I always end up late after work so I dont dare try the coffee. As a result, I drink non-coffee... Ive tried Matcha, Bubblegum and several mocktails like Pamela and Berry & Kenny. Matcha is okay, Bubblegum is okay, yes like milk based drinks in general but they are delicious. The mocktail??? Well done!!! Fresh abiezzzz. I prefer the Berry & Kenny one because it has a sweet taste but also has sourness. The appearance is beautiful . Pamela is really refreshing but really sour. Its more suitable if you drink it during the day when its hot and then after eating, hahahha. For snacks, just order potatoes. It turns out the potatoes are really delicious and the portion is quite big  . Location & places Hidden in a residents house area. The place is spacious so if you hang out and have a good time, it wont be crowded. Coming here on weekday evenings at 9, its really quiet. The place is  aesthetic  and every corner can be used for photos. There is indoor smoking too. Service Very friendly and initiative. At that time they had already turned off one light. I took a photo in front of the cashiers window, but suddenly they took the initiative to turn on the lights because they knew I was taking a photo. Also ask one of the other baristas beforehand. The position was already half past 11, what time do you close? The answer was 11 oclock, Sis. Just relax, Sis, if you still want to sit around, thats fine. heuheuheu       for the service Onkel Johns will be my favorite place in Tebet.

When you first entered, the service was good and smiling. Proceed to the direct food ordered. The Karage Fried Rice (+-50K Including Tax) here is delicious. The portion is filling, the salad is quite tasty, but the karage is slightly undercooked, maybe using high heat so it only looks cooked on the outside. Its recommended Then onto the drinks, there are lots of choices but non can also be an alternative. I have a suggestion, the sweet iced tea has too much sugar, maybe you can give the option of reducing the sugar. Thanks yeah",1

First impression: the place is really cool. It is said to be comfortable, the AC is cold, and there is an outdoor area too. 5/5 for the comfort of the place. All food menus are empty (spaghetti/rice/potatoes) only bleger beef (empty blegger chicken) and drinks are available. Most impressive is Koplo Bia coffee. Rating for coffee 5/5 Its really delicious, it feels creamy even though the ice has melted, and the single shot of espresso is perfect for those who want a light drink of coffee. If you want a double shot, you can choose Koplo Abi coffee. The rating for the blender is 4/5 I like the mayo sauce, its like a special concoction because it tends to be sweet. The fiber level of the meat and bread is okay. Rating for service 3.5/5 Sorry for the cashiers assessment which was less than satisfactory because the cashier argued that all the visitors money was large (they were asked to pay using just the right money or qris). Hopefully in the future we can better regulate the small money available at the cashier. The waiter is very friendly with a smile. Plus value. Always healthy, blessed, sir, waiter. Amen. Other facilities 4/5 There is a prayer room with sufficient area, indoor and outdoor areas, and toilets. The parking area is quite limited. The womens toilet is not suitable for locking. Hopefully it will be repaired soon for customer safety and comfort. For those who are curious about Sis Zaskia A Meccas restaurant, please stop by Pinarak.",1

If the kimbab tastes good, 8/10, the filling is egg, crab stick, carrot, yellow pepper/radish, I think. The rice is fluffy and tastes of spices. the pieces are big.

There arent many variations on the menu, just choose what form of carbohydrate you want. The texture of the noodles is big, tough & dense so its quite filling. The taste of the soup is unique, savory without being overpowering, thinly sweet & fragrant, plus lettuce. Another unique thing is that on top of the noodles there is also a kind of bakwan/fried food which is possible to add texture. Overall delicious & unique experience, no wonder there are so many customers. Unfortunately the price is quite expensive, 1 portion of noodles is 40 thousand, if you add fried meatballs / dumplings with soup + a drink its also 50 thousand per person. For chicken noodle fans, you must try it because it really tastes different from the others.",1

I like pineapple and sticky layers, typical old school but delicious. As for ramen, I havent tried it yet because I dont really like it, next time I take a friend who likes ramen, he once took me to a busy Jemb5 restaurant and it just tasted normal. At first I thought it was because the ornaments were too red with lanterns but it turned out I was wrong, right? This is a ramen restaurant  it suits the Japanese feel. In my opinion, if the door is open, make people come in or put up a banner on the price of ramen   because its cheap, it makes people dare to come in.",1

The first time I came, I was greeted by Mbak Aurel: Even Mbak Aurel helped direct good photo spots at the outlet. Then my table was assisted by Mas Bagus and Mas Ito; and there is one more person (sorry, I really forgot his name)  . Mas Bagus chose a suitable menu for my mother that was safe for my parents taste buds. Mas Ito is also extraordinarily friendly in serving food and drinks. It is very visible that everyone who works at Greyhound Menteng does their work with joy; even though its the Eid holiday and they should be going home.

Give notes to have extra oil (since there would be time for delivery, and im afraid the noodles will stick together, really glad that the seller read my notes, my orders came as requested). I get noodles topped with quarter hard boiled egg, red chasiu pork, chopped sweet pork, caisim, spring onions and fried onions), taste wise their noodles is sweet and savory (just a little hint of sweetness, not over the top). Portion wise theyre pretty nice, definitely gonna order more from them. Gonna rate them 3.5 out of 5. For more info about foods, kindly visit asmunchkin on IG.",1

One more proof of Gods greatness. You could be given the opportunity to visit this place... unexpectedly at an altitude of +/- 1200 meters above sea level and at the very end, if you go up from the safari park gate there is a coffee which I think is very interesting to visit. At first it was just for fun browsing for dinner places around Seruni/Hobbit where my family was staying. Suddenly the name of this coffee appeared and we finally decided to accept the challenge of going up here... As a result we arrived at our destination... we werent sure about the map we were using but we still pushed up  . The right place at the wrong time in my opinion, because I arrived here at 8 pm, so the view really couldnt be seen because it was really dark the whole way up. Maybe in the afternoon I can enjoy the atmosphere here more, okay? But all of our journey was satisfied when we arrived here... the food was delicious, especially the fried banana... the rice bowl was delicious, the fried chicken was also delicious. The espresso was just as expected Plus the place is cool, comfortable, not stuffy... its really good for refreshing the brain... The service is also friendly. My advice is if you want to come here in the afternoon so you can really see the view... And dont forget that the car must be in good condition because the climb is quite good... its not scary, you just need to be extra careful and have a high driving experience (no beginner) especially if you go up at night.

Message Sekoteng Mixed Round (Big Small) The Aer Ginger sauce is delicious, spicy, fresh, just the right amount of sweetness. For small rounds, there really isnt any content. The big round is filled with nuts and sugar, its delicious. For sekoteng, this is the complete version: there is white bread, barley, large rounds, small rounds, palm fruit, peanuts, pearl beans, green beans, and also seaweed, if Im not mistaken. Its all here. The price is pretty good, 22 thousand if I remember correctly, for the cute bowl. The bowl is really small, its different from the kang sekoteng bowl that you drink, the bowl is indeed small, but this version is even smaller. Even though the bowl is small, I think it contains quite a lot compared to the ginger water. So yes plus minus. In other places, maybe the bowl is a little bigger than this but fills it with a little more water. If this is a small bowl, theres a lot of filling. In fact, I could have given it 5 stars if only the salesman sitting at the cashiers desk had been friendlier. This father is really mean. Like it or not, I didnt receive my order paper.

Even though the location is a bit hidden in a residential area, it is easy to find by following the directions from Google Maps. The design of this cafe is quite unique because it combines an industrial feel with an astronaut feel. The front and side terraces are designated as smoking areas. The inside is filled with various comfortable seats with mural backgrounds and various adorable knick-knacks. Facilities such as power sockets, toilets and prayer rooms are also available. Chicken Cordon Bleu (Rp. 58,000,-) is a piece of breaded chicken breast fillet filled with smoked beef and mozzarella cheese and then fried until golden brown. The texture, as can be clearly seen from its appearance, feels so crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken meat is still juicy with a cheesy cheese sensation. The barbecue nuanced dipping sauce adds to the taste, making it even more savory, slightly sweet and smokey. Powdered fried potatoes are a delicious, salty and savory carbohydrate component. Fried Banana (Rp. 25,000,-) the perfect choice of banana because it is ripe on the tree so it feels soft and sweet and caramelized. The flour crust is crispy with the addition of grated cheese, chocolate sprinkles and a drizzle of sweetness, making this snack menu even more delicious in your mouth. Iced Kopi Susu TCC (Rp. 22,000,-) this drink tastes refreshing. The balanced combination of coffee, milk and palm sugar makes it taste sweet, creamy and enjoyable...",1

This is my first time visiting here, in the afternoon around PK 18.00. Service 9/10 The server is friendly, informative and the service is quite fast. Drinks came out approximately 5-7 minutes after ordering. The food took a while, around 20-25 minutes, when it arrived it was quite busy, there was a private room which was full, so I ordered there first. Place 9/10 There are choices of large tables, medium tables and small tables. Lots of plugs, on the walls and on the floor. The room is clean, a bit dark, but still okay. Good for WFC or for meetings. To use the toilet, you have to go outside, towards the back of the cafe. A little note, many of the plugs in the housing are damaged, some of the plugs on the floor also dont work. Maybe it could be a note for maintenance or replacement. Squid ink fried rice 9/10 The portion is quite large, the taste is good overall. I like it. Just quite a long time, almost 1/2 hour wait.

I was first informed by my friend that the coffee at The Harvest Express was quite delicious and the price was affordable compared to the coffee sold in Gambir. And its true, the price of drinks here is around 10-12 thousand per cup. Apart from that, the price of bread and slice cake is only around 12-20 thousand. I ordered a Tuna Sandwich for 18 thousand. At that price, I found a sandwich with a standard size in general, but there was a lot of tuna meat. I dont know if this is still in the promo period because it has just opened or that is the shops policy. What is certain is that it can be an alternative destination to buy drinks and food to accompany your train journey. Recommended.",1

Its not just bread and bananas, now they have variations from mentai rice, sushi, sweet and salty kinds of canai bread, kebuli rice... In short, some well-known Japanese and Middle Eastern dishes in Jakarta. And some good ol nostalgic Indonesian dishes such as bakwan malang, bakso, and classic nasi goreng. Want some Westernish and Chinese dish? Fear not. They have spaghetti and dimsum. See? You shall love their idea of offering you tons of choices that you can try whenever! I love the latte served by Komeet, It tasted funny so I asked if the latte was coloured with some fruity essence. And since his honesty giggled me, I accepted. In fact, I brought home an iced cappuccino and he gave me another half cup of his NEW MENU! Since I forgot the name, you should figure this out yourself   Im just telling, the coffee just suits the atmosphere of Ropisbak Ghifari. Nice people deserve nice treatment, and it goes both ways.

Because its close to home, you can walk, but its also close, about 5 minutes from the Juanda TransJakarta Bus Stop and Juanda Station. From the outside, Dapurempa looks beautiful, small and beautiful, like on Santorini. The inside is also simple but comfortable and the room arrangement and interior design are really eye-catching, especially the selection of good tiles. You can use it as an OOTD spot here. The place is comfortable plus a fast wifi connection and the staff are super friendly plus old school music makes you feel comfortable sitting here for a long time. This time, I ordered Iced Coffee Latte and Banana Nugget. Iced Coffee Latte for IDR 33,000 is served simply with separate sugar. The bitter taste is felt on the tongue right down to the after taste, the milk also tastes without being overpowering to the coffee. The texture is also just right, neither runny nor too thick. To accompany your coffee, order Banana Nugget for IDR 25,000 wow for that price and the large serving portion its really worth it. The banana nuggets were crunchy, and the banana flesh really suited my taste, soft, not too crumbly and very sweet. Of the 4 bananas, there is only 1 which is a bit hard but thats ok. You can request toppings but I just mix them, sweetened condensed milk, grated cheese and chocolate sauce. Lots of abundance but not too much. Overall its nice, I want to hang out here for me alone because the ambiance is quiet and comfortable. Close to home again, another plus point.",1

The location is on the Alfamart terrace. The parking area is one with Alfamart so its a bit limited. Especially for four wheels, it is very limited. The taste of the kebab filling is very authentic, with typical Middle Eastern spices being very dominant. The kebab skin is also delicious, the thickness is just right. There are two choices of filling on the kebab menu, chicken and meat. There is also a burger menu. The spiciness can also be adjusted, level 1 to level 5.

On the second floor there are board games and comic books, making the cafe atmosphere seem more homey. The matcha cheese cake is delicious, the portion is also generous, you can share it together. Almond Croissants are also crunchy and buttery. The coffee is made with cinnamon, which personally doesnt suit me. We also tried the food but forgot to take photos. The hamburger is delicious, for me the oyako don is not suitable because it uses floury chicken katsu meat and doesnt have a lot of eggs. Overall delicious, I will come back for the cake and pastry.
