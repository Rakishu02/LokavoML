The parking lot is quite spacious, its just a bit scary if you enter/exit without the help of a parking attendant, because its right at the roundabout. Dangerous hahaha The choice of drinks and food is varied. Just not very many. Even though the taste is okay in my opinion, the portion is also okay. Prices are quite affordable, although perhaps for plenty of people in this Huis the food and drinks are a bit expensive (a little) at least in bold, underline too The ambience is homey, the interior is cute and beautiful. Its fun to hang out with your small family or close friends and partner. The service is also quite good, from ordering to delivery of the order it doesnt take more than half an hour, so far so good Please keep up the good work!",1,1.0

The location is in Cempaka Putih, the place is nice, quite aesthetic even though its not too big. The atmosphere is comfortable, the place is clean and the service here is also quite friendly. Here there are various variants of cheesecake and also a drink menu. I tried several menus 1. New York Cheesecake (37,000), I think this is really delicious. The texture is soft with a dominant cheese taste, complemented by a separate strawberry sauce. It tastes really cheesy but delicious, doesnt make you tired and really goes well with the thick and fresh sour strawberry sauce. Recommended! 2. Mix Nutella (38,000), if you dont want too much cheese, you can try this menu. The taste is more dominant with nutella chocolate, the sweet type but the sweetness is still just right and there is a slight salty taste because there is a layer of cheese too. 3. Hot Latte, the coffee is quite strong and dominantly bitter. You can add sugar if you want it sweeter. 4. Iced Matcha Latte, I think its delicious because the texture is quite creamy and the matcha still has a bitter taste, a little milky with a sweet taste thats not excessive. Its not the sweet & watery type of matcha so I think its delicious.",1,0.0

The interior wall of this caffe is well and beautifully decorated with Japanese ornaments and wooden wall panel. My favorite spot is Indoor Seat. I recently dined there as i saw an ads on Instagram about this caffe. For the appetizer, i ordered gyoza, It was crunchy & savory. For the main course, i ordered chicken noodle, It was divine. For the drink, i chose choco milk, It was saccharine. The ambience is true magical. Overall, I would really recommend Ejji to everyone",1,0.0
