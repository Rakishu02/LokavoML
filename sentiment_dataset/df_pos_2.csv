Its a trivial matter, but it cant be taken lightly either This afternoon I came here and I accidentally spilled my own drink which automatically spilled drinking water onto the floor (where I was lying on the floor), even though the water only spilled a little. I asked the boss who was delivering my drink for a nap, but the boss didnt respond, didnt know what to hear, so that was it. Well, followed by my friend who just came, he automatically ordered and a menu was delivered to where my friend and I were, coincidentally the one who brought it was different from the one who delivered my drink earlier. I tried to tell the boss to ask for a rag Sir, can I have a rag? (While pointing at the water on the floor of the floor) Thank God, bro, there was a response, Oh yes, just a moment, Sis. I waited, it took a long time, and suddenly the two of them (the one who delivered my order and the one my friend had) came to us, delivering another menu from another friend of mine too, maybe the other guy was looking for another customer whose order he brought. I hope the bro brings a rag, hehe, especially since the two of them came (I asked both of them to help bring a rag). Hey, in fact, they didnt bring a rag at all, even though they looked at me, we looked at them as if I were looking, Wheres the rag, sir? :( But the darling doesnt seem to notice, did you forget? In the past, I also asked the boss who delivered my order for a rag, and then he came again with a rag. In the future, hopefully we can pay more attention and listen to what customers say.

There is talang iced tea which I think is very authentic, packaged beautifully too. But please give me input   , the pavilion (house) that makes payments/cashier, when you first entered it smelled really uncomfortable, but I was confused about what the smell was. Between the smell of cat poop or wet and dirty soil or something   . So its not very comfortable when paying, so you have to cover it with a mask. But the rest is really okay.
