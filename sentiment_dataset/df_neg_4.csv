It was explained that there was only a dimsum menu, and even then only a few were ready stock. But I dont want dim sum anymore. Skip. Then I asked again, is there toast? There arent any either. Are there French fries? There arent any either. Then he explained that the only thing available was burgers, cireng and bananas. Finally ordered cireng.

There was no one in the coffee shop, I was the only customer.. and I had to wait 20 minutes for a single cappuccino. I was like okay fine, this better be good. Um turns out, the barista put too much milk & the temperature was super super hot and tasted super bad. -  hot chocolate 2/5 slighty better only waited for 5 minutes for this. But it was just chocolate nothing special. They said that they use dark chocolate but it literally tasted like chocolate sachet -  Croissant 2.5/5 kinda taste like it s yesterday s croissant I wouldn t review extreme bad reviews if the staff would at least apologies or says thank you when I gave them feedback. But when I told the barista, he kinda shows that he disagree and didn t care about my feedback at all. Well, I expected better service.

The place is not bad, the service is very friendly, the serving takes a bit of time, and the taste of the food needs to be improved. Order fried rice, the rice is soft, at a price of 30 thousand you only serve rice and crackers without eggs, chicken or meatballs. Its not worth it even though the taste is decent. Lalapan quail (55 thousand), lalapan duck (60 thousand) is not worth it either, only served with rice and quail or duck, without any addition of tofu or tempeh and also very little chili sauce, even a little duck meat and given pieces of head. Ice lemon tea( 25 thousand) the taste is also very lacking. Rating:7/10",0,1.0

We dined in November 2023 and we still talk about how horrid the onion rings were up till today whenever we see onion rings in any menu. This is a self serve cafe. You need to scan a QR code to order and then pick up the coffee from the counter. Food: We ordered some coffee, nasi sambal ijo, onion rings. The coffees were ok (3.5/5) Nasi was ok (3.5/5) Onion rings (-10/5). Yes, that is a negative. They were extremely hard to bite into and not chewable. Our jaws hurt just trying to eat them. They were most definitely re-fried. We sent it back and the server gave us another bowl that had exactly the same texture. Atmosphere: Outside was attractive. Inside, wasn t hygienic. There were big flies everywhere. They landed on our food and drinks. A small fly trapping device was placed in a corner but no flies went there. Sofa was dirty. Suggestion: Please monitor the food quality Train the food handlers. They don t appear to be experienced. Reevaluate your garbage disposal protocol. Nearby shops didn t seem to have this fly problem.

In fact, this food court could be a selling attraction for customers who buy apartments behind the food court, but this place is NOT ATTENTIONAL at all. I am not a seller or have a tenant there, but an honest review of visitors/buyers. In fact, one of the reasons why I wanted to buy a unit at Oak was because of this food court. In my heart at that time... Its also nice that theres a food court downstairs, if youre too lazy to cook, you can just go downstairs. But the result is BIG ZERO. There are increasingly fewer visitors here, sometimes its a pity to see those who trade, all they do is play on their cell phones all day. Their stories say they only get 100-200 thousand/week, while the rental price is expensive. Please managers read all peoples reviews. Pay attention to the traders there, the rental price should not be too expensive, check whether the market is busy or quiet. Promote on social media, make live music, clean the food court which is really dirty full of leaf litter, dust, rats etc. Even though there was delicious food there in the past. There is Stickusteak which sells delicious steaks and my favorite drink SARSAPARILLA, Aceh noodles, fried rice in the corner, Korean style ice cream, typical Medan food. Everything is there... and the price in my opinion is still affordable. And now there are only 2-3 tenants left. Sad! The management must really take this seriously, must be able to bring Alun Alun Oak to the way it used to be, let all of Jakarta, especially North and East Jakarta, know that you have a cool place to hang out. If you dont clean it up, believe me... its just a matter of days before all the tenants will leave and Alun Alun will only remain in name.

After the appointment time was determined, I came to the clinic and met with the doctor to explain the results of the examination and package options. Then after finishing, I was told that I couldnt consult with a nutritionist because I had already gone home. And the doctor said that if you can schedule a follow-up consultation with a nutritionist. But the front part doesnt work. So the price package is changed according to their wishes so its only doctors. Why wasnt I informed from the start that the nutritionist wasnt there when I made the appointment? For the problem that the nutritionist has gone home, why not follow up with another consultation according to the package I took? Is it because the price of the promo package for new patients is cheap, so they are treated arbitrarily? Why does the receptionist just arbitrarily decide something different from the doctor? And just change the package so its easy. But its detrimental to the client. For your nutritionist who has gone home even though there are clearly patients who will be consulted, thats none of my business. I dont know your schedule.

If its just a drink of coffee, its pretty good... ordered cold viet drip chocomilk and honey garlic. the vietdrip is very tasty, the beans are fresh, the barista is a pro. The chocomilk... I think I used milo or ovomaltine hahahahah. If its like this, its definitely a mess. It took 40 minutes to order and get to the table. Its just the Viet Drip and Chocomilk. Various foods were empty, only a few choices were available, so only ordered honey garlic. I was patient and waited 1.5 hours to eat the honey garlic.... unfortunately the 1.5 hours passed in vain... there was no news about the food, it was like I was ghosted by my crush. And it turns out the waiter only confirmed again after 1.5 hours. YAY, OUR ORDER WAS JUST FORGOTTEN EVEN THOUGH PAID IN ADVANCE. Still waiting patiently, it was my turn to be confirmed that the kitchen was empty, empty not because it was finished, but empty FROM THE BEGINNING... right from the start it said it was available. Where do you pay immediately at the beginning of the order? OK... be sincere, cancel and refund. Waiters agreed to cancel and refund, saying later the money would be delivered to the table. Oh, you know, Ive been waiting for 45 minutes, but theres no news... Ive finished my coffee, finished my chocomilk, my stomach is hungry. The waiter was asked, he answered okay, wait, okay? OK, another 10 minutes of waiting... instead the waiter came back to confirm Is everything ordered, bro? Its easy like this... hungry people are even played with.

This makes it quite uncomfortable when visiting. Motorbike parking only costs IDR 1000. Cool place equipped with cold air conditioning and friendly waiters. This place is famous for its fried chicken menu. At the end of 2023, you can get a promo every time you make any purchase at this KFC store. The promotion will be visible on your purchase receipt. 1. KFC Crispy Burger --> The appearance is quite attractive according to the price. The combination of the flavors of the bread and the filling is perfect, the crispy meat lives up to its name. Equipped with chopped mustard greens, garlic, tomato sauce and mayonnaise 2. Cream Puff --> A type of long bread shaped like churros with a bread outside and cream inside. The taste doesnt fit and doesnt blend together (not recommended) 3. KFC Pudding --> Instant pudding placed in the refrigerator, the taste is good but the chocolate is not sweet enough, the texture and softness are suitable. Unfortunately the packaging smells bad. 4. Scramble Egg --> Smells and looks like regular scrambled eggs. The taste is slightly pronounced and the texture is slightly fluffy. Vegetarian options: On the vegetarian menu, you can choose a small menu such as snack pudding, cream puffs, or other non-vegetable dishes. Dietary restrictions: Dietary restrictions are not recommended because this is a fast food restaurant that does not support diet programs. Foods high in carbohydrates and sugar. Parking: The parking lot is located right in front of the KFC Diponegoro Ungaran store which can accommodate more than 10 two-wheeled vehicles and several four-wheeled vehicles. Kid-friendliness: This place is suitable for children because it tastes right in childrens mouths, there is a kids menu, so you can hold birthday celebrations for children. Wheelchair accessibility: Access for wheelchair users in this place is quite difficult because to enter the store you have to climb several stairs first.",0,1.0

ChIJb9AgwhtXei4RXigcsC4eEeY,849ed6522a792f62d401465ce295cbb2,3,2024-01-14,"My credentials as a food critic are simply decades of eating at every level of restaurants in Los Angeles.  Everything from $1 chili dogs to $60 steaks. This is not to compare with them but to give my honest opinion of the offerings at Opera. In the past week we have eaten at Opera three times.  Twice for dinner, once breakfast. Each meal will get a brief critique and rating, 10 being food heaven, 1...forget about it. Big Breakfast Described on the menu served with an omelette.  Instead the eggs, dead center on the plate, came undercooked sunnyside up, soaking the surrounding item with mucus like egg whites.  Later I saw a photo of the meal showing sunnyside eggs, not an omelette.  The accompanying sausage were two small, taste lacking, hot dogs.  The potatoes and salad were good. Score...2 Eggs  Florentine Very nice dish.  The eggs were perfectly boiled, resting on toast with a very good avocado spread, similar to guacamole. Score...8 Meltique Ribeye Teriyaki I have absolutely no idea what the meat is on this dish.  It looked nothing similar to the great photo they have posted.  It seemed to be some form of beef that had been pulverized and reconstructed.  It did not have a steak like texture and looked like reformed Spam.  I ordered it with spaghetti as a choice  was offered, rice being the other option.  It got delivered with rice.  I sent it back for correction.  The spaghetti in a mushroom sauce is unremarkable. Score...1 My wife had the barumundi fish entree twice.  Each time the meal was different. We also ordered the fried mushrooms, both times different in quantity and taste. These inconsistencies can result in the downfall of any business. My friends sandwhich order never got noted.  He had to reorder after everyone else was served. Opera offers a wonderful selection of delicious pastries.  This is their forte.  The cheese cake is excellent, when fresh. Cinnamon rolls delicious, just to note a couple. Update on pastry. It is stored in open air displays.  The heat and humidity will destroy them rapidly. My friends cheese cake was awful. Old, dried out. Ambiance is okay.  All meals were eaten in the front AC room.  We prereserved  a table for five, as they do not have much seating in this area.  Our table was waiting upon arrival with a personalized reserved sign on it.  Nice touch! Service is you all too commonly found Indonesian method.  Take the order, deliver the order.  Only return when hailed.  Otherwise, youre on your own. Recommendations Deliver meals that resemble the photos. Wait staff be attentive. Stop serving that steak I ordered. Serve all meals warm at the same time.  Ours came one about every five to ten minutes. Overall score...7 Out of the five in our group, three enjoyed their entrees.  Two vowed not to return for food but would for pastries/coffee.  All agreed that for the price there are better offerings at other restaurants. As mentioned this is only MY opinion.  No two experience anything alike.  I recommend trying Opera, most likely you will enjoy it. Update!  In response to your response. No one asked how I want the eggs. The Meltique Ribeye looked absolutely nothing like the photo on your site and when I showed it to the waitress asking for that meal was assured I was ordering that meal, not what I got...If that is waygu, I was not at all impressed. My wifes barumundi meal one night was encircled with mixed vegetables, last night it was totally different. These substitutions are a serious problem for a restaurant.  I can guarantee most patrons want what they see, that is why they order specific items.  Perhaps it was a mistake for us to have looked at the photos posted on your website before we came, after all, they were what stimulated us to come. Sorry, but highly doubt after three visits within one week that we will return for a meal.  We will return for pastries and coffee, but will not take the risk of having problems that seem to be ongoing. Thank you for your reply.",0,1.0

Harusnya waiter bisa ngerti buat melakukan service yg baik dan benar. Saya bolak balik mesti ngechat admin IG, telfon dan segala macem hanya karna masalah miskom internal mereka.

Itupun dateng paling akhir,  karna harus diingetin dulu ke waiternya kalo kita pesen paket buka puasa.
