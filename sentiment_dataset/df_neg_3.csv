Fried noodles: tastes bad, sticky. I have a photo. 5/10 2. SantN beef soto: the taste is still okay, 7/10. But it took a long time to come. Ordered from 5 oclock, the intention was to break the fast, but the food only arrived at 6.30. 3. Chocolate toast: this tastes delicious, the chocolate is quite thick. 9/10 4. Iced milk coffee: the coffee is delicious 8/10 5. Ice cream toast: childrens favorite 8/10 Thats all my criticism. Hopefully the taste of food other than bread can be improved. Dont worry about the noodles. Thanks.",0,1.0

The concept of this coffee shop is good and very young and also aesthetic. The parking area is large so it is very easy to get in and out of vehicles. There is space for live music performances too, which seems to be only on weekends. For venues, there are 2 choices, outdoor and indoor. The outdoor area is also very spacious and there is a rooftop option. Even indoors is quite spacious. There is a prayer room and toilet too. But all of this is not balanced by the cleanliness of the place, which in my opinion is lacking and even looks poorly maintained, especially the indoor area and rooftop. The stairs to the rooftop are also dangerous, especially during the rainy season. What is most surprising is the time for making food and drinks. Long time.

Eh, the food was delivered after the Isha call to prayer, thats because we asked 3 times before it was delivered. There was a new CS who arrived but he was served first. The others have already gone home, our food has just been delivered. There are also orders that we miss. If we dont comply, why dont we miss the food, maybe the food wont be delivered. Ive also worked in a restaurant so I know how complicated breaking the fast hours can be, so I made a reservation so that it was prepared beforehand, but it turned out to be a trivial matter for CS. If we reserve a day in advance or come without a reservation, we still understand. Hopefully it can be even better in the future",0,1.0

I waited for about 40 minutes to eat iftar, and when I asked the cashier, it turned out it hadnt been made yet. I really dont know how a fairly large cafe could do something so fatal. This is my first time at Cafe Trenggalek and this is a very bad impression. At least if youve made a mistake, why cant you come to my desk and just apologize. even though I paid, I didnt ask. When complained, the waiter was rude and didnt accept input. Please the management immediately correct this kind of attitude, because it is very inappropriate in the eyes of customers.

Drinks: ordered Cold Tea Pot Gingerlime, bland, not sweet, not sour, served not using a Tea Pot but using a French press. The glasses are made of paper cups which are sluggish, not glass cups or glasses which are really used for drinking tea, like those that are free at mosques.

The place is really comfortable indoors in Cempaka Putih. Deliberately went to Matraman hoping to be as comfortable as white cempaka and indeed wanted caramel coffee as well as a snack to break the fast. It turned out that the first time you entered it was already uncomfortable, on the right side in front of the cashier there were sitting around, either visitors/employees lying down at 4 in the afternoon or maybe 4-6 people actually sleeping. , I dont think its appropriate for a cafe carving to sleep lying on a bench against the wall, because it looks dirty, the girls and boys are combined into one lying on the chairs, even though the room is AC but the guys are smoking, Im really annoyed. Finally, those who wanted to go indoors had to go out because they couldnt bear the smell of cigarette smoke in the AC room. It turned out that outside the smell of cat pee was so strong that it would move to any bench, the table was not well looked after, so how could it be cleaned so that the smell of cat pee didnt stink sob. And the jacket had ten feathers falling from the tree, sob (luckily I was wearing a jacket). But for food, I recommend it and like the Chicken wings, they are delicious, the spaghetti is delicious, unfortunately the coffee is a misperception. I was told that I wanted caramel and a topping like white cempaka, but I was directed to machiato. Even though I deliberately went there to get the caramek coffee. But never mind, just wrap it up and enjoy it without complaining. I just thought the atmosphere wasnt like the one in Cempaka Putih. Hopefully in the future it will be better and more comfortable",0,1.0
