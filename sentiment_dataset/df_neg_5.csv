Main courses are predictable and decent, but taste-wise, not wow. 1 waiter really does his job, hats off, while the rest of the service team, I can see from their faces that they were hoping for the customers to just not exist     Didn t feel welcomed or appreciated at all. Nobody holds the door on our way in or out, they were standing 50 cm from the door though, watching us trying to get in. Maybe it was a bad / moody day for them that day, who can tell. I don t think we will come back as I find nothing special in terms of taste of the food  and the steep service fee we paid was definitely not worth it at all.",0,1.0

I was told that all the meals and even the sandwiches take 40-60 minutes to serve. Also the duck prosciutto, cos they said it was fresh. Do you slaughter the duck to order or why do even appetizers need 40 minutes? 2. I ordered sourdough and butter for an appetizer. The staff refused to give me a knife at first because I was only eating bread. When I tried to explain why I need a knife for the butter, they brought me a spoon. 3. If one has to wait almost an hour for their food, then please at least provide wifi. The sourdough here and the butter are still my favorite, but you need to remember theres LOTS of good bread in Malang and if this is the quality of the service you cant rely on good food alone to make sure people come back. Also, Im all for expats learning the local language, but the location being frequently visited by tourists, it might help to get English-speaking staff and not people who just say okay okay when they dont understand you. xxxxxxxxxxxxx Went for the croissant, stayed for the sourdough. They make their own butter too and its just divine. Shame I couldnt try their lunch dishes, but will be back for sure.",0,1.0

When bitten, there is a strange taste, a fragrant aroma and a slightly sore sensation on the tongue. So I asked the waitress if the vla uses rum. The answer is, you do use rum, but it has zero alcohol. Finally I threw away the rest... My advice, for products containing rum, it is best to inform the buyer, especially if you know the buyer is wearing a headscarf, regardless of whether the rum is zero alcohol or not. Besides, not using rum actually doesnt really affect the taste, its still delicious, for example the Holland and Harvest brands, which have become increasingly popular after getting halal certification.

I complained, mosok was reckless to be served in conditions like that, the waiter answered because it was his job to serve. Finally I protested to the cashier, and asked for a shady place.

Those who say this place is cool, Im sure they often get hot. Ha ha ha. The food is delicious, but the way it is prepared means that the fried fish, which should be able to be enjoyed for meat, becomes very small. And the price is EXPENSIVE in my opinion for city people. Remote place although it can be found via Maps. According to the child, he wanted to fish, rented a fishing pole for 5,000 but there was no bait. I didnt catch any fish for more than two hours. It doesnt look like there are any fish. One more thing, if you order food at this place, the price does not match the menu. Later, the chili sauce and fresh vegetables will be charged again, and that is not included in the menu list. Meanwhile, the menu list only includes gourami, tilapia, pomfret fish, which can be fried, grilled, grilled with honey, sweet and sour. Also white rice, sweet tea.

We ordered papaya salad, pad Thai, fried chicken in Bangkok sauce, and brisket. Incidentally, the mango salad was sold out, so we chose the substitute Papaya salad in the hope that the taste would be close to the authentic taste. However, its disappointing because because it uses ripe papaya, it doesnt have the crunchy taste found in Thai salads, its not sour enough and doesnt seem to have any special spices like that. Rating 3/10 The Bangkok fried chicken is ok, rating 8/10. The Pad Thai, which is predicted to be a champion food, is no less disappointing. The texture is sticky, mushy, even the fried kwetiaw in Nasgor Tektek is still better. Rating 3/10 The brisket is tender, but a little salty, so you should eat it with a side dish. There is a choice of Texas or Thai Style, the only difference is the side dish. Texas with baked potatoes or French fries, while Thai style with Naan or rice. Rating 6/10.

Other than that, they also offer various type of grain, such as black rice, basmati, furikake rice, and so on. The restaurant allows the customer to customize their meal by choosing from those wide array of grains, proteins, and vegetables. In my opinion, this customization option is one of their strength. Customers who are familiar with the dishes can order the foods according to their preferences, and for those feeling explorative can have the freedom to mix and match the dishes. They also offer a curated menu for those who does not want to think much about what combination is good. I ordered the skinny fish red curry with lychee. It is supposedly one of their customers favorite, and the combination also piqued my interest, as I never had the chance to eat a savory meal combined with lychee. Since I came on a weekday, they also had a promo, so I got a discount as long as I bought drinks. I chose their House Blend Iced Tea. Once the dish came, I have to admit that I was disappointed. The meal came with basmati rice (I believe), fish, cauliflower, broccoli, lychee, and few slices of pineapple (which surprised me) slathered (kind of) with red curry sauce. My first impression was that the meal did not look appetizing, although I think it was partially due to the haphazard plating. The portion was also on the smaller side, especially for the fish and vegetables. Most notably ,however, was the thinly slice of fish meat, I guess it lives up to its name as it is really barebone. I understand that the intention is food restaurant with consideration of nutrition balance and healthy diet, but I think for the price tag, they can give more of the side dishes. For the taste of the meal, it also confused me how the menu can be a favorite. The basmati rice each stand on their own, which I came to enjoy actually, but the curry sauce was more on the sour side. The fish was barely there, and the vegetables had quite a crunch. The cauliflower was noticeable since they were a bit sweet. What compelled me was the pineapple and even more so, the lychee. I am unable to comprehend on how to eat them, I can see that a pairing of sweet and sour can be delightful, but the pineapple had sweetness that overcame the currys sourness. The lychee, which has even more sweeter flavor, actually made my tongue recoil in confusion. I dont see how the sweetness of the fruit can complement the sourness of the dish since they ended up overwhelming the tastebud. Other than the meal, the iced tea is okay, not memorable for me to comment, but it is decent and the free refill can be quite nice. The place looks okay. It is inside a mall, so the air conditioning and cleanliness is top notch. The interior design reminded me of old-school or vintage American diner (not that Ive ever been there). Theres not much I can say about the place. All in all, it is regrettable for me to say that I did not enjoy the food, and I think it is a bit too pricey for the portion. I have certain fondness of plain healthy food, but even it did not help me to savor the meal. I think this place is recommended for those who wants healthy options with a customizable menu (and enough disposable income), which can be great for the customer to not get bored. For those who is interested to try it out, I think you have to make sure you understand the flavor profile, otherwise youll end up like me who was stuck with sour curry with sweetness overload of lychee and barebone fish.",0,1.0

Im a bit panicked because its already late at night, its different from when its daytime or evening. Luckily, I remembered a friend who was studying near the cafe and finally called the friend at 23pm to ask for 2 THOUSAND cash to pay for parking so he could go home HEHE",0,1.0

Before coming, my aunt had made a reservation and ordered the menu. I arrived at the place at half past one, the first food didnt come out until about an hour, and the first drink didnt come out until about half an hour. And even then, drink FLAWLESS ICE TEA, friends.   The distance between one food and another is many times the time. Then my aunt ordered an iced drink (I already ordered it when I made the reservation), only to be told that the iced drink was empty after waiting for about 2 hours.   Ive already avoided it. After that it was replaced with coconut ice, but its been a long wait. And what I saw was that the serving was not finished at one table first, but it was as if the chef liked whichever one was served first. The funny thing is, at the Joglo there were about 3 families eating there, and we looked at each other and felt bad because the service was bad.   My big family and I have been waiting until half past 4, almost 4, finally decided to go home. Is all the food out? Oh of course not, mate. There are still 2 or 3 menus that havent come out yet. I also ordered pizza, which pizza takes up to 2 and a half hours to cook?????? Maybe in the future the workflow can be improved.

First, I really was surprised with the pricing for all the food presented on the menu, despite hearing those claims already from my friends. There is no where else that I know of that has prices as affordable! Carpaccio, Escargot, Steak, Pasta. These all could be found in the range of 50k - 150k.  Insane! I was really happy with the authenticity of the establishment as well. We came as a group as we ordered a whole bunch of food. The menu was really alluring. When the food came, it was really HUGE PORTION. Most of the menu, the group really enjoyed them. We ordered the soup, pizza, the steak, the appetizer tuna, king prawn special of the day, Seafood pasta, the Duck with potato gratin. Personally, the food were just mostly okay for me. It didnt quite leave any lasting impression for a revisit. Some menu were too salty (potato gratin, king prawn), and the juices were way too diluted. The one that tasted better is probably the Duck. My least favorite is probably the Seafood pasta, it has some artificial taste somehow. My other guess is probably the kitchen was really busy, because its almost full house when we got there, could probably be reason the food isnt as good as the hype for me.",0,1.0

But apparently now the arrangement is different from the photo, inside there is only 1 table and 2 chairs, the rest is used for sound equipment and guitars. The toilet is also dirty, think again if you want to go there. Even though the hot chocolate was delicious, the toast was okay.",0,1.0

Moreover, food without a spoon, whats the concept? Even though we were given 5 spoons, they were plastic spoons, even though we were supposed to be VIP... so we ended up eating the rice bowl with our hands:",0,1.0

Coincidentally Im full (because Ive finished eating) So ordered 3 glasses of coffee, 1 glass of Milo FYI, there were six of me sitting (sister, mother and husband) My mother and sister still felt full, so they didnt order anything to drink. But their service is not great Miss the waiter, the outdoor section on Sunday 4 February 2024. Curse + bitchy. Actually... its not the first time Ive been here, this is probably the fifth or sixth time. Because coincidentally the house is also close. But this is the first time, I got a waiter like this I wont come here again, just last time. There are still many coffee places in JGC that are more worth it than here.
