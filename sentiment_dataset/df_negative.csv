I wont complain if I dont hurry, the problem is that my child wants swimming lessons and the time is really tight.

Its as if you already know that its 1 cup extra, even though I only said 4 cups and didnt explain how many cups it was. And after that it was continued that was my friend who said there were 4 scoops. Very relaxed and without feeling guilty. Immediately I said, please look at the table where I was, there are several cups there. (I was starting to get annoyed and wanted to grumble. And imagine if there was 1 item that was extra on 10 bills). Even after I ordered gelato, I heard my friend only mention 3 types of gelato that I ordered. He spoke so casually as if he was used to it. Until I received the refund, he didnt even say Say sorry. Second, there is no cashless service there.

I was about to finish drinking, then after 65 minutes the food came. An hour of my time was wasted. When the restaurant waiter was asked, the answer was just wait a minute while looking away. There really is no etiquette at all. Its a shame even though the food is quite delicious. But for me, service must still come first.

Actually, the price is okay, commensurate with the menu. But I am not comfortable with the way the service provided by the local party. Based on my experience, I held an event at this place with full confidence and full confidence that the local party wanted to cooperate. At first the response was welcoming until we believed that Teteh and Aa were very friendly and the facilities were complete and it didnt make it difficult for us to hold an event, basically this party was very supportive at first, but in the second and third meetings when we were going to make a reservation, the way of service was still His attitude towards us was very different from the first meeting, where his attitude changed, at first the meeting was very friendly and supportive, but the next meeting became less of that attitude, if the language was perhaps a bit jutek, sorry, sorry, Tea, we are too Customers here and of course pay, cant we not pay? We also of course still have an attitude. Maybe in the future, so that customers are comfortable with local parties, our advice is to improve the way we serve customers. To be honest, it really hurts me when the teteh says we dont want to lose either hehe, even though here we also pay without going into debt, the proof is that we make payments according to the agreement, we carry out the instructions from the teteh without being complicated, what should be done first is that we also carry out the dp first. We are disciplined, right? We have attitude, right? We also pay the rest according to the price without any complications. And what personally hurt me the most was when he said words to customers that he shouldnt say to customers, thats what made us uncomfortable. Even though there we only want mutualism, thats how it is, sorry, this is according to what I experienced when I visited this place. Maybe in the future it would be good to respect customers more and speak kindly to customers, after all we also pay and dont just ride. Payment is neither less nor more. We were just disappointed by his tetehs words which did not match the words we started chatting with. Hey, okay, I recommend it. It seems like we really dont want to lose, what are we really losing? Heheh, it really hurts... Im quite surprised, this is the first time Ive found less than good service from local parties to their customers.

But the front part doesnt work. So the price package is changed according to their wishes so its only doctors. Why wasnt I informed from the start that the nutritionist wasnt there when I made the appointment? For the problem that the nutritionist has gone home, why not follow up with another consultation according to the package I took? Is it because the price of the promo package for new patients is cheap, so they are treated arbitrarily? Why does the receptionist just arbitrarily decide something different from the doctor? And just change the package so its easy. But its detrimental to the client.

Never been so disappointed with the buffet menu and taste. There are very few menu variations, from main courses, fruit and desserts which are not in the same class as a 5 star hotel buffet. Doesnt match the photo. The arrangement is similar to a wedding buffet so you have to queue because there is no other choice but to queue in one place. The taste is below standard. For the price of 328,000++ it is very below average. And when asked whether this was really a standard lunch or just because there was a group meeting because there were so many people coming with coupons, the restaurant staff said yes, this was their standard. He said if you want there are lots of choices on Saturdays and Sundays. Are Monday to Friday prices considered cheap so just what is needed is enough? Not to mention the added disadvantage because the seating location was placed in a place where the air conditioning didnt tend to get hot because the location was a bit open and couldnt be moved because it was full because it might be a group meeting booked. Very disappointed because the intention was to please the office staff but zonk. Hopefully it can be noticed and fixed.",0

But there doesnt seem to be any initiative from the cafe to give small cups filled with hot tea or anything to break consumers fasts. Because the server had told us the order would take a long time, even though we had arrived since half past five or five. If the cafe knows that there are lots of orders during the fasting month, and the queue for food is long, at least there is a jumbo cake filled with tea to break the fast first. We cant bring food and drink from outside. Well, this isnt it. Consumers have to wait a long time for their orders to arrive. Even just drinking, we only ordered Saparilla and we just gave them a cup of ice and a bottle and had to wait a long time after sunset   people were going to faint.

But yesterday there was something odd about the service side... 1. Now with up to 10 guests there must be a minimum spending of 250 thousand/person and under 10 guests there is no minimum, this is a bit strange, is Cicia worried that many people only order a few, even though the menu is quite large, and strangely without there are VIP facilities; 2. We came as a group of 12 when we entered directly and were informed that there was a minimum spend, we asked about the policy which said we were not fair, even though we usually spend more than 250 thousand per person, but we felt like we would be judged if we couldnt afford to pay in language and poor communication; 3. OK, we accept that it doesnt matter if there is a minimum fee for more than 10 people, we will try to suggest that later the bill be divided into 6 people into 2 groups. the tables on the opposite side are separated...this makes us even more offended, because in front of us there are 3 empty tables, that means enough for 12...why did Tari ask 1 to move to the other side...these are employees who are not at all customer oriented!! Deliberately making us uncomfortable with our proposal to split the bill!!! Finally, 12 of us were able to sit together and we spent an average of 600 thousand per person!! One more thing that annoyed us... when we paid we were given free pieces of food (snacks/bread), wow... they think that by giving them food people like me can easily forget about their bad service...NO WAY!! Sorry we didnt receive the food and we still criticize Cicias poor service...for future improvements!! Thanks",0

For wonton noodles, the noodles apparently havent been seasoned at all, just the noodles are boiled and then put on a plate. The filling for the wontons is a bit dry, different from other branches. Then I told the staff there about the unseasoned noodles, who approached me wearing a shirt (not wearing a waitress uniform), took my kie plate and took it to the kitchen. Then he returned the noodles that had been added with soy sauce & said maybe the previous seasoning had been absorbed because I hadnt stirred the noodles for a while, and didnt even apologize for the mistake, let alone replace them with new ones.

Very long service. We had to wait 45 minutes for the first order to come (dimsum) and 50 minutes for the drink to come (ice tea) 2. The taste is very unsatisfactory. The crab dimsum has no taste, its bland, its just hot. Watery curry. The chicken didnt taste fresh (it really didnt taste fresh) and was cut into 2 small cubes 3. It seems like there is a shortage of employees because it looks like there are only 2 employees doing a lot of work.

Thai beef salad (9/10) The salad was fresh, beef was generous, dressing was spot on. 2. Omali (6.5/10) Omali is basically Umm Ali, but their version was somehow a bit too dry. 3. Deep fried gohyong (7/10) We felt like it was more like a beef roulade instead of a gohyong(?). The gohyong itself was okay, and the sauce was spot on. 4. Silk fried rice chicken (6/10) We paid 95+ for this but what came was a very ordinary fried rice with very few toppings. We definitely expected more. 5. Saigon chicken (7.5/10) Big portion, juicy chicken, could use a bit more seasoning. 6. Wagyu Intercostal MB6-7 (8.5/10) This was the star of the night. Well seasoned, well cooked, perfect. Price is quite steep and with the quality of the food, we sadly wouldnt come back. Service is good, attentive staffs. Ambience is fine. A few parking slots are available.",0

The taste of the food is very ordinary and tends to be unpleasant. The gudeg and krecek are really ordinary, unlike anything Ive ever eaten anywhere else. The fried chicken is really bland, there is no taste at all, at least please marinate it with spices. The staff is NOT FRIENDLY, but there was one who was friendly. Service was not in order, 2 families who came after me were served first. Please give the staff who on 12-16-23 wore moss green clothes, black hijabs, jeans, pink sandals another briefing. I called the lady, then she responded, but when I asked why my food hadnt arrived yet but the one who ordered after me had already arrived, the lady looked away pretending not to hear. Since yesterday Ive been thinking about whether to review honestly or not at all, but in the end I decided to just review honestly so that no one regrets it like me. After I read the reviews, it turns out that many people have experiences like mine, its really true that I have to honestly review this stall, hopefully that can change.

This is the first time I intend to look for reviews just to express my discomfort with a product just because of bad service, Ive never had this before... for new students, I dont think this is a recommended drink!!!",0

Ive ordered food and drinks and Ive paid because the system doesnt open the bill, I just have to wait for the food to be delivered to my table. About 10 minutes of waiting at my table, a group of people came, then they were already looking at my seat, and it wasnt long before one of the waitresses came to me and asked, Brother, can you move to the bar table for one person? Because they wanted to use the table, they were busy. Even though the situation next to me was the same, 2 people were using a table for 4 people. But because the tables are individual, they can be separated or combined. I automatically just looked at the waitress who was speechless because I was in shock for the first time experiencing something like this. After getting my reaction, which already made my face uncomfortable, the waitress thought, she asked the person next door to borrow a separate table, so I moved there so that the table I was at earlier could be shared with the people who had just arrived earlier.

Actually, I dont know whether this is only at Popeyes Bintaro or at all Popeyes, but its true that whats in the photo doesnt match reality.

The grilled and sweet and spicy grilled chicken is also small, not the same as the photo. Honestly, its like customer fraud in my opinion. Put it in for Popeyes.

One thing I like is that it s provides you with a decent refreshment options while you wait your car to be cleaned which not most carwash provides. Service is almost none existent as it simply order, wait, and eat For the food and drinks, i ordered their waffels which shape like a honey comb, the outer can be made a little crispier, but taste wise was not bad, but wasn t special either. But I always love the taste of their fresh squeezed lemon variant, it tastes sour but refreshing. I also try their milk boba drink, it was OK to say the least. Overall, although the price point is a bit on the pricier side, but I do recommend to try their lemon variant in a hot days to refresh yourself.. ;)",0

Just a suggestion might be to provide a place to write out of stock/empty menus so customers arent disappointed. thank you burjo level up",0

Headchef Putri executed our buffet menu superbly, everything was delicious. What is unfortunate is the service. Some waiters do not receive instructions well, and their behavior is not good in dealing with client requests. The cliche excuse is that they still dont have a shift, even though our event doors open at 18:00. There are still staff giving briefings in the VVIP area with food on tables that are not cleared up. However, there were several waiters and waitresses who worked optimally, there was Annisa, I still asked for several things from her, she politely said, Ill prepare it, bro, but now my shift is over, if there are other requests, other colleagues will help me. but until 7 oclock, I still saw him helping with our event. There was also Ka Adul who responded very quickly when I asked for a glass of whiskey to be sent upstairs. The security is great, friendly and very helpful to the guests, there are 2 receptionists at the front, 1 is busy drinking and eating and sitting, the other has his hair in the booth, in fact he is very active in receiving guests. The DJ is great, can bring the atmosphere, even until 1 am the guests are still there. But overall, thanks Chef Putri, Ka Joy, Annisa, Adul, and the receptionist who had her hair in the booth. You did a great job, at least from the many waiters who give me headaches, you have relieved the headache.",0

The service is okay and the atmosphere is in accordance with the concept of the place. Then we ordered several foods, namely Fish and Chips, Spaghetti Bolognese and Roasted Duck with Orange. For Fish and Chips, its still okay, it tastes delicious, although in my opinion the tartar sauce doesnt have enough kick. For Spaghetti Bolognese, to be honest I dont know whether the sauce is actually that dry to the point where there is almost no sauce and it tastes bland like that. I was embarrassed because it was eaten by my guests and it didnt taste very good. Then for the Roasted Duck with Orange, to be honest I dont understand what the orange is for and it doesnt have any importance in that menu. The duck is cut like that so its very difficult to eat with a knife and fork, I think its easier to eat with your hands, but is that true? One more thing, the duck meat is tough, hard to cut and hard to eat, dont expect a menu that expensive but the taste and experience are not good. Well, just hope that there will be changes regarding the taste of food in the future.",0

The indoor area is small, there are only a few tables and chairs, but dont worry, there is a toilet. the toilet is also clean. At that time the service was quite friendly. I ordered churros as a snack. But why is it that the churros here are a bit soft, the texture is similar to cakwe but smoother, thats all. The dipping sauce is also not melted chocolate but caramel. I had high expectations at that time, but I didnt expect the churros to be so crispy and the dipping sauce to be chocolate like those sold in malls. For standard cafe prices, please improve the churros recipe so that customers dont have high expectations. And oh yes, one more thing for De Jongs staff, if there are customers who are having me time, dont pay attention to them and often stare at them like that. I felt a bit uncomfortable, even though my intention was just to finish the work. If I look around, my appearance isnt strange, Id be a bit annoyed if I found a cafe with staff like this. Otherwise, this cafe is worth a try for those who are curious about its vibe. but, repurchase? noo. Im sorry if my assessment is something you dont like, the staff and owner of De Jong. I wrote this assessment based on my experience when visiting this cafe. Always success",0

Maybe you can think about other treatments so that visitors are more comfortable and dont worry about food or drinks being thrown out. 3. Leaves fell onto the table where we ate. Luckily I ordered fried rice. If its in soup its definitely going to be really annoying. The suggestion is to install a net cloth. 4. Food portions honestly agree with other reviewers that the portions are too small. You can add it to make it more palatable to eat. 5. Make sure that when plating, any other traces are wiped off.

This makes it quite uncomfortable when visiting. Motorbike parking only costs IDR 1000. Cool place equipped with cold air conditioning and friendly waiters. This place is famous for its fried chicken menu. At the end of 2023, you can get a promo every time you make any purchase at this KFC store. The promotion will be visible on your purchase receipt. 1. KFC Crispy Burger --> The appearance is quite attractive according to the price. The combination of the flavors of the bread and the filling is perfect, the crispy meat lives up to its name. Equipped with chopped mustard greens, garlic, tomato sauce and mayonnaise 2. Cream Puff --> A type of long bread shaped like churros with a bread outside and cream inside. The taste doesnt fit and doesnt blend together (not recommended) 3. KFC Pudding --> Instant pudding placed in the refrigerator, the taste is good but the chocolate is not sweet enough, the texture and softness are suitable. Unfortunately the packaging smells bad. 4. Scramble Egg --> Smells and looks like regular scrambled eggs. The taste is slightly pronounced and the texture is slightly fluffy. Vegetarian options: On the vegetarian menu, you can choose a small menu such as snack pudding, cream puffs, or other non-vegetable dishes. Dietary restrictions: Dietary restrictions are not recommended because this is a fast food restaurant that does not support diet programs. Foods high in carbohydrates and sugar. Parking: The parking lot is located right in front of the KFC Diponegoro Ungaran store which can accommodate more than 10 two-wheeled vehicles and several four-wheeled vehicles. Kid-friendliness: This place is suitable for children because it tastes right in childrens mouths, there is a kids menu, so you can hold birthday celebrations for children. Wheelchair accessibility: Access for wheelchair users in this place is quite difficult because to enter the store you have to climb several stairs first.",0

The visit was our 5th visit because we love the food and ambience here which really never failed us before hence every now and then when people asked me where to eat and have light drink prettily I would recommend Shu Bar, particularly the one in Plaza Indonesia. That being said, the visit this time was a bit off on many fronts: 1. Table - we requested a window seat if available, which we were advised full, so we seat elsewhere. On this table though I noted the tablecloth was dirty with food stain and notify the waiter. The respond? that is the stain from mala which we have tried to clean but cant. I mean.. even if I go to a cheaper restaurant I rarely find dirty tableclothes..? Surely a restaurant with Shu Bar class could afford new and clean tableclothes?? 2. Food - we ordered a lot for a party of 4 (cause like I said earlier we used to love the food). A few notable off things on this visit: - mantou which was served with stir fry bamboo shoots and bacon were COLD af. - not the first time we ordered this, so we know those mantous were supposed to be hot; - we ordered whole duck and being served half duck; when we confirm 2 waiters said it is whole duck until my brother pointed kay, this is 1 wing, and this is 1 thigh.. how may wings and thighs does a duck has? Only then the waiter realized it was indeed half.. they apologize, took it back and serve it back.  What being served as whole duck looked like 2 halves combined.. as half of them very DRY for a roasted duck compared to the other half; and some burnt (we can taste the bitterness from burnt food) 3. Service - friendliness and attentiveness could be improved. We really loved Shu Bar and hoping we wont experience the above for our next visit (as and when we recover from the not so lovely experience).. And the table next to the window? The whole time we ate no one sit until the waiter/waitress took off the table settings and close business for the day. Pretty sure that wasnt the definition of full.",0

The promotional menu I ordered was Ubud fried rice + lemon tea for 42,000 and cheese mayo sandwich + three dara coffee for 39,000 (if you just order the sandwich its 30,000, if you just order the coffee its 25,000, its quite tempting). I also tried the sexy blue artisan tea. The fried rice is seasoned somewhat like yellow rice, accompanied by fried egg, chili sauce, crackers and fish satay. Honestly, the taste is just normal, the matah is delicious but theres nothing special about it. I also tried the chicken cheese mayo sandwich. The filling is quite dense, the chicken is delicious, the mayo is just right. The drink is lemon tea, thats fine. The three milk coffee consists of Wamena Arabica Coffee   Palm Sugar and milk. The taste is okay, not that thick. The artisan tea is delicious, soothing with warmth. There are two non-smoking rooms on the ground floor and a smoking room on the top floor. Actually, its more refined above, you can work while feeling the breeze in front of the window (lots of plugs again) but yes, because its a smoking room, of course it wont be pleasant because even when you arrive, no one is smoking, but maybe later someone will smoke. Maybe of all the food flavors Ive tried, I havent found anything really great, but for just working or relaxing in the afternoon, this place is good for smoking or non-smoking rooms.",0

The mixed pork rice is quite delicious, the rice is bland, it helps if you add the complementary soy sauce, the pork topping is quite filling. The broth that is given is not useful, its just like water with pepper. The fish n chips were not satisfying. The shape of the fish is fat like banana molen, only thick in flour and tasteless. The fries are better because they use a brand of coated potatoes, so they are just right. Overall, for the price and taste, we really dont recommend the fish n chips.

Not all of the food came and it took a long time even though I had asked for it 40 minutes ago. Im confused about whether to open a restaurant for gabut or what to do? its not true *PLEASE TRAIN THE SERVICES MORE SO THAT THEY HAVE GOOD ETHICS!* 2. food - Chicken steak doesnt have a cool taste, the seasoning is really good - the spaghetti bolognese looks like its not fit to be eaten. The seasoning that is poured over the spaghetti tastes musty, not like spaghetti bolognese in general which is suitable to be eaten. - The lemon tea served has animals in it? Didnt you check it first beforehand? Then the lemon tea tasted like sunlight, even though it was a plastic cup & plastic straw, was the cup reused? How is it possible that plastic cups and plastic straws have the scent of sunlight? - Please pay attention to the appropriateness of the food served 3. atmosphere - can a cat come in??? - given a high table with a pair of short chairs???, just imagine when customers were told to eat while squatting on a short chair like that???

Chicken dumplings: just ordinary and 1 portion contains 4 pcs. 2. Lo mai kai: more like chicken lemper. It tastes great 3. Choipan: of all the things I ordered, its better to have the choipan. 1 portion contains 5. 4. Salted egg Bapao: the contents dont melt, it just tastes B. 5. Soymilk: there is original, milo, oreo, and regal. I like the formal one. Just ask for the plain one without sugar because if you use sugar it will be very sweet. Overall, the place is small and a bit dim. Very fast service. Theres also Uno if youre bored or just playing with friends. The food is just B. Good luck!",0

(even though the outlets operating hours are still long), is it that difficult to make jasmine tea?

When my family and I arrived, WE WERE NOT GREETED, SERVED OR ASKED TO EAT IN THE PLACE OR TAKE AWAY AND FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE. EVEN THOUGH MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 10 MINUTES AT THE GUEST TABLE. VERY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER OUTLETS THAT ARE DIRECTLY SERVED. EVEN THOUGH, WHEN I ARRIVED THE OUTLET WAS QUIET AND I SAW EMPLOYEES IN RED CLOTHES PLAYING ON THEIR PHONES 2. When I ordered, I noted that the drinks came out later when the food was finished and this was informed by me or my wife because we ordered 7-10 types of food for 6 people and the table would definitely be very full. In fact, the food has NOT FINISHED, my wife or I have NOT INFORMED THE DRINK IS OUT, but the employees have already brought out all the drinks. Ive been informed, dirty plates are removed first then drinks are delivered because the table is full. But in reality, THE DIRTY PLATES WERE NOT PICKED UP, WHILE THE DRINK WAS DELIVERED AND PUT DOWN, WHICH RESULTED IN ONE GLASS OF AVOCADO JUICE SPILLING ON MY MOTHERS Shirt AND INTO MY MOTHERS GINGER MOCKER. DONT GIVE A SUBSTITUTE, JUST NOT SAYING APOLOGY TO MY MOTHER!!! 3. It took more than 30 minutes from the time the order was entered to arrive at the table for eating. This took a long time because of the quiet conditions. When I looked, the kitchen only had 1 or 2 staff. 1 waiter in black clothes, 1 waiter in brown clothes, and once again the employee in red clothes just silently looked at the screen and held the cellphone without helping at all. I dont know what position this red shirt is in, but at least it helps when the waiter is overwhelmed 4. When the food arrived, there were orders for noodles and kwetiau. At other outlets, it is usually served directly with sauce, chili sauce, soy sauce, etc. But at this outlet I waited 30 minutes and it wasnt delivered, until they said twice it was delivered 5. The mango fruit served on snow ice was not fresh because when I wanted to eat it it was already brown. Finally I asked for a change and just take away. When I ate it (the distance from the Imperial Kitchen outlet to my room at the Holiday Inn was less than 5 minutes) the mango was half frozen. Is it true that the fruit at this outlet goes in the freezer?? 6. When I asked for the bill and there were 2 menus that I asked for take away, the employees facial expression immediately changed when they heard that. Like saying just add more work 7. When I received the bill, my 2 children asked to be taken to the toilet. Without having time to check the details of the bill carefully, I gave the money to the waiter and I said that the chocolate shake didnt come out, either to my wife or the waiter. When I returned from the toilet, I asked my wife to double check the bill details? The wife said that as soon as the money was received, the waiter went straight to the cashier so the wife didnt have time to check. And when he came back the waiter just gave change without giving details of the bill. Looks like the waiter didnt check either Note. 1 glass of spilled avocado juice 33,900. 1 glass of chocolate milkshake which didnt come 25,900. So 59,800 + 5% service charge and 10% PB1, the total is 69,069 which I have to pay without drinking or enjoying it at all. Would you say its a small amount? Cant you say its a big number? Its just that I have to pay for drinks that werent delivered, and I also have to pay for drinks that were spilled due to the waiter and Imperial Kitchens mistake. Maybe this is the first and last time my family and I eat at Imperial Kitchen, Citiwalk Gajah Mada branch Even if my family and I stay at Holiday Inn again, we wont go to this branch again Vegetarian options: There are some menus that might be possible but it seems like the cooking utensils are combined with non-vegetarian menus Dietary restrictions: Dont understand this Parking: Can park at Citiwalk Kid-friendliness: Can Wheelchair accessibility: Can",0

The food information is empty when it has been in place for an hour and the order has not been delivered at all. It is the turn of the person who has just arrived to be served their food. If a lot of food is empty, its best to close the place and just buy the ingredients so that buyers dont have to wait more than an hour just to eat. Someone ordered nasi timbel after me, in fact it was his that was not mine. This place isnt too busy, what if the place is crowded? How many customers will complain?!

From there I immediately thought, it must be a bad meal. And sure enough, according to my husband, the Dateng burger was pretty good. When I tried the pizza part, the meat tasted like it had been in the freezer for a week. Why do I know? Yes, because I like to cook too, so I understand the meat I just bought this morning and put it in the freezer for a long time. Finally I understand, dont just trust reviews on Google. If the reviews are good, why is the restaurant empty of customers? Thats what must be asked. The prices are the same as the steak restaurant, which is in the neighboring galaxy.

I waited for about 40 minutes to eat iftar, and when I asked the cashier, it turned out it hadnt been made yet. I really dont know how a fairly large cafe could do something so fatal. This is my first time at Cafe Trenggalek and this is a very bad impression. At least if youve made a mistake, why cant you come to my desk and just apologize. even though I paid, I didnt ask. When complained, the waiter was rude and didnt accept input. Please the management immediately correct this kind of attitude, because it is very inappropriate in the eyes of customers.

But compared to Starbucks, its still cheaper here For heavy food, it takes a long time to come out. So Im already hungry. Then the price of the food is heavy, if you compare it with Sate Senayan (because the menu is similar), the price here is quite competitive, but its less and the taste is also not worth the price.

I asked the waiter carefully, This is lemongrass iced tea, right? then the waiter immediately answered in a less friendly tone that what we ordered was regular iced tea.

Everything from $1 chili dogs to $60 steaks. This is not to compare with them but to give my honest opinion of the offerings at Opera. In the past week we have eaten at Opera three times.  Twice for dinner, once breakfast. Each meal will get a brief critique and rating, 10 being food heaven, 1...forget about it. Big Breakfast Described on the menu served with an omelette.  Instead the eggs, dead center on the plate, came undercooked sunnyside up, soaking the surrounding item with mucus like egg whites.  Later I saw a photo of the meal showing sunnyside eggs, not an omelette.  The accompanying sausage were two small, taste lacking, hot dogs.  The potatoes and salad were good. Score...2 Eggs  Florentine Very nice dish.  The eggs were perfectly boiled, resting on toast with a very good avocado spread, similar to guacamole. Score...8 Meltique Ribeye Teriyaki I have absolutely no idea what the meat is on this dish.  It looked nothing similar to the great photo they have posted.  It seemed to be some form of beef that had been pulverized and reconstructed.  It did not have a steak like texture and looked like reformed Spam.  I ordered it with spaghetti as a choice  was offered, rice being the other option.  It got delivered with rice.  I sent it back for correction.  The spaghetti in a mushroom sauce is unremarkable. Score...1 My wife had the barumundi fish entree twice.  Each time the meal was different. We also ordered the fried mushrooms, both times different in quantity and taste. These inconsistencies can result in the downfall of any business. My friends sandwhich order never got noted.  He had to reorder after everyone else was served. Opera offers a wonderful selection of delicious pastries.  This is their forte.  The cheese cake is excellent, when fresh. Cinnamon rolls delicious, just to note a couple. Update on pastry. It is stored in open air displays.  The heat and humidity will destroy them rapidly. My friends cheese cake was awful. Old, dried out. Ambiance is okay.  All meals were eaten in the front AC room.  We prereserved  a table for five, as they do not have much seating in this area.  Our table was waiting upon arrival with a personalized reserved sign on it.  Nice touch! Service is you all too commonly found Indonesian method.  Take the order, deliver the order.  Only return when hailed.  Otherwise, youre on your own. Recommendations Deliver meals that resemble the photos. Wait staff be attentive. Stop serving that steak I ordered. Serve all meals warm at the same time.  Ours came one about every five to ten minutes. Overall score...7 Out of the five in our group, three enjoyed their entrees.  Two vowed not to return for food but would for pastries/coffee.  All agreed that for the price there are better offerings at other restaurants. As mentioned this is only MY opinion.  No two experience anything alike.  I recommend trying Opera, most likely you will enjoy it. Update!  In response to your response. No one asked how I want the eggs. The Meltique Ribeye looked absolutely nothing like the photo on your site and when I showed it to the waitress asking for that meal was assured I was ordering that meal, not what I got...If that is waygu, I was not at all impressed. My wifes barumundi meal one night was encircled with mixed vegetables, last night it was totally different. These substitutions are a serious problem for a restaurant.  I can guarantee most patrons want what they see, that is why they order specific items.  Perhaps it was a mistake for us to have looked at the photos posted on your website before we came, after all, they were what stimulated us to come. Sorry, but highly doubt after three visits within one week that we will return for a meal.

First, I really was surprised with the pricing for all the food presented on the menu, despite hearing those claims already from my friends. There is no where else that I know of that has prices as affordable! Carpaccio, Escargot, Steak, Pasta. These all could be found in the range of 50k - 150k.  Insane! I was really happy with the authenticity of the establishment as well. We came as a group as we ordered a whole bunch of food. The menu was really alluring. When the food came, it was really HUGE PORTION. Most of the menu, the group really enjoyed them. We ordered the soup, pizza, the steak, the appetizer tuna, king prawn special of the day, Seafood pasta, the Duck with potato gratin. Personally, the food were just mostly okay for me. It didnt quite leave any lasting impression for a revisit. Some menu were too salty (potato gratin, king prawn), and the juices were way too diluted. The one that tasted better is probably the Duck. My least favorite is probably the Seafood pasta, it has some artificial taste somehow. My other guess is probably the kitchen was really busy, because its almost full house when we got there, could probably be reason the food isnt as good as the hype for me.",0

From the start we werent told anything, when asked, the answer was only yes, not yet, just a moment. After arriving, the taste of the food was just ordinary, tending to be less delicious. The aglio olio is watery, not oily. Carbonara is also not like carbonara.",0

However, the shop writing is not very visible. My main dish was Nasi Sei Beef. What I like about Sei Sapi is that it uses flour-fried spinach leaves. I really like crispy food, but unfortunately some of the fried spinach leaves are a little soggy. The beef sei is quite delicious, the chili oil is spicy but a little too salty for me. Second food, Nasi Gule Beef. This is delicious, the sauce tastes good, the meat still uses slices similar to Sei Sapi. After eating, I go to work, so I have to snack. For snacks I ordered Cireng, for the sauce I was given something like rujak sauce. The sauce is not too spicy. However, the Cireng itself is a little bland in my opinion, even though it is sprinkled with spice powder. Complementary drink, as usual coffee. I ordered Iced Kopi Susu Kampung. The taste is quite good but the coffee doesnt taste enough. The place is comfortable enough for chatting or WFC. Some spots provide sofas, its very rare for me to see Sei shop providing sofas. Sei Beef Rice (3/5) Beef Gule Rice (3/5) Cireng (2/5) Kampung Milk Iced Coffee (3/5) Parking: Parking lot is often full, often directed to parking on the side of the road.

Salted egg fried squid, the shell wasnt crispy when it was fried so when it was mixed with salted egg seasoning it immediately became soft and lumpy, the salted egg sauce also had no taste. 3. The white rice is pera. If you make fried rice, its probably delicious, but if you serve it as is, its like eating rice. 4. Butter fried chicken, the chicken has been fried in flour for a long time, and it turns out that the tempung chicken was indeed fried en masse and then stored on the preparation table. So it is suspected that the chicken had been fried for a long time. 5. Fried capcay is very salty and the sauce is thin without thickening.

Set up is really nice menu is diverse however the service literally did not exist. They dont clean and sanitised tables after customers only pick up the dirty plates and when you ask then fir help they say is a self service. The weird thing is that it is not that they do not have staff, they have plenty however they seem so disengaged and bored that is hard to even get thier attention. Prices I might say is expensive as you can see from the photos of the menu posted by other customers. Food is in the best case average, they have a buffet with local food however if you order noodles you will get dry packed egg noodles which is not even remotely close to  even the simple mie cart on the streets of Yogyakarta. I personally had a burger which came a rare in best case medium rare they never asked my wife that order the burger what temperature I would like to have it. It will not be a problem if the burger was uneatable however I was struggling finding any good flavours while removing the pieces of raw meet between my teeth. My wife asked them to change and they took it away, 3 minutes later I received my burger and for my surprise it was the same burger that I tried to eat earlier they just put it back in the grill burned it and send it back, lets not forget that when the waiter tried to serve my burger the patty fell on his tray and he tried to fix it with his fingers. After realising it was the same burger the send tk me I went I request to be changed however it took me more than 5 minutes until I found someone that can speak English. At the end the burger took more than 30 min to came again on the twentieth minute I just went and ask them to canceled the order by the time we were leaving on of the staff xame running after us with the take away. I do not understand how one of the biggest hotels in Yogyakarta can tolerate such a service!!!",0

Its normal because a new cafe might need time to expand the space, hopefully in the future it will be expanded and more comfortable. As for the review, there will be a welcome drink, mmm...idk, but as far as I can see there isnt any  . As for the menu, its a shame that the food menu is less varied, there are more drinks, maybe because its intended just for hanging out. But even with a small menu, the service takes quite a long time. Waited more than half an hour for the drinks to come out, and still had to wait another half hour for the food to come out even though there werent many people. The total wait was around 1 hour. What was even more disappointing was that I had been waiting for half an hour for the food to come out, there was a menu which turned out to be empty and the customer had not been informed (when ordering there was no empty information for one of the food menus) and this was only informed when the customer took his food at the service near the cashier. As a result, I had to wait a few more minutes for the food to be made and promised to be delivered to the table, but it turned out I still had to pick it up myself . The expectation was that the food would take a long time to come out, hoping it would be warm because it had just been prepared, but it turned out to be cold  . Regarding drinks, I also have to ask, is the concept of the drink really less sugar? Because what is received is really less sugar / tasteless (trying positive thinking). The iced tea didnt have any sweetness, the coffee base (cappuccino & coffee late) that was received also didnt have any sweetness because the coffee was very bitter (Im not a coffee lover, and dont understand the taste of coffee, but the same menu at other places is more palatable). Hopefully in the future the coffee will be even better. The suggestion is to improve the service and kitchen management because a 1 hour waiting time is long and will make visitors disappointed, add more food menus to make it more varied, as for the drinks, I dont know whether its because of an error or if theres just a lack of sugar. Maybe it can be repaired again. Another suggestion is that if there is a menu that has just run out, you can go to the customer and ask what they want to replace, because if you have paid in advance the menu should already be available. Dont just let the customer know when you pick it up. Weve been waiting a long time. For now, prefer to go to the place next door, which is certain. The first experience was quite disappointing. Hopefully this can be used as input for the owner and management to be even better at providing a pleasant experience for customers.",0

The queue is in front of the access road from indoor to outdoor (smoking area). I was queuing in front of me, only 1 person left. There was one of the Waiters with ombre hair in the style of style passing by in front of me and going to the indoor area next to the showcase which contained cakes. Just wandering around without asking permission or anything. OK, I understand. Alas, the female waiter went back to the smoking area and this time, in my opinion, she had no more attitude because she passed by and bumped my bag. I was surprised, he didnt say a word of apology or anything like that. I didnt really care because the road was narrow, but please, is it difficult to say mission or sorry while you have a mouth? And I reflexively shouted, Thats the attitude he has towards customers. I dont know if he heard it or not, he just walked away like he didnt mean anything. I ordered and to be honest, the cashier was very rude at first. After I ordered quite a lot of 5 foods and 5 drinks, the lady was not so polite at the beginning haha. Long story short, I already got a seat and after my order arrived, I called this lady again (because before my eyes I only saw her) to ask for help to get the sauce, I waited for about 15 minutes and she didnt come. Finally, I asked the male waiter for less than 5 minutes to give him the sauce . As for food and drinks, everything can be enjoyed. The manager really needs to teach an attitude towards the female waiter whose hair is ombre in that style, like the initials of her name (D). I used to work at FNB and really tried to be friendly to customers because if the place was quiet, who would they pay?",0

It s really stupid and insulting to people who wait for their food to be served. I ended up waiting for AN HOUR for my colleagues  food to be served due to this ridiculous system.

So maybe it needs to be trained again so that the service is uniform. - the food is a bit inconsistent with the title. The salted chili tofu is more like flour tofu with fried chili sauce.

However, I was disappointed with the service of the cleaning staff, because my food had run out but I waited there even though it wasnt too busy and there were still lots of empty chairs, the cleaning staff asked if the food was packed or eat here, I answered eat here but it was finished as if I shouldnt wait there, it shouldnt have been like that because I was also charging my cellphone at that time. Please fix it next time, because Im a GM Bakmi customer either at the station or in malls and this is the first time Ive been treated like that :(",0
