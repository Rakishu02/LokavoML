Parking is not very large, but sufficient. *Services: -They are all friendly. -And quick response when we book via WA. -There was a little problem, but they responded quickly. So when it was time for the Maghrib call to prayer, there was no drink or food served at our table. Even though we have ordered H-1 via WA. We need to confirm again with Jeeva. Only after that, the menu was brought out quickly *This cafe is beautiful and elegant. They have indoor and outdoor (more of a semi-outdoor I think). Their indoor ones are there for large groups too. *They have clean toilets. *Closed ablution area (only boys and girls together). *The prayer room is small, but they have lots of mukenas and they are clean Actually, this is the 3rd time Ive been to Jeeva, but this is the first time I can review it  . *Food review: Yesterday I ordered 3 menus, but here I can only review 2 menus. Because I didnt try the Betawi jeeva soto  . -Batak Gomak Noodles: MashaAllah, this is really delicious    . The sauce is a bit thick, but delicious. Even though its red, its not spicy. However, it turns out that this menu must use stick noodles. And in my opinion, these noodle sticks are big, easy to break but not chewy. But the taste is really delicious 8.8/10 -Wagyu Crazy Rice: The wagyu is really delicious (but wagyu must be delicious anyway   ). 8.3/10 *The point is that all menus are cooked with a sincere heart  . Jeeva not only charges prices that are a bit pricy, but they also think about the taste and appearance of the food *Oh yes, during fasting, they have a Ramadan menu, you know *And enter for Jeeva: please, if the table has been reserved, dont just write on paper and tape.

As for the area, there is an indoor area on the 1st floor and an outdoor area in the backyard. Meanwhile, the 2nd floor area is more specifically used as a working space, so students or employees who want to enjoy WFC in the coffee shop can use this area. Apart from that, the most interesting part is the bar table which uses a modern modular bar concept which is still rarely found in coffee shops. For a fairly complete menu, I ordered a hot cappuccino and a hot cafe latte, both taste similar, light but creamy and have a delicious sweet fruity sensation. Overall, this coffeeshop is a coffeeshop in Jogja with a vintage and modular bar concept which provides a different experience for enjoying coffee accompanied by the enjoyment of their coffee offerings.",1,1

The first time I found out about this was from Ms. who was looking for coffee at Gofud, ehhhh it turned out that when I tried it, it was ENAKKK! but forgot to order coffee which is basically a type of kopisusu but its really delicious, creamy types of coffee, but not as bitter as other coffees, typical coffee which is suitable for accompanying evening assignments because its not something that will make you unable to sleep ha ha ha ha ha, thats the point . The second time, finally tried it straight away and the vibes were cool and cool. It seems like its still new and Ill be coming here often, haha, because Ive never seen a cafe in that area before. For the Kepanjen location, this place is in the hot spot category for young people because the cafe is ~~aeSthetic~~ like that, especially if you come around 4 in the afternoon, you really dont know where to take a photo spot because its that good. Because the dominant color is neutral, it makes it great for photos using any camera . I just didnt try to taste the heavy food, but the snacks are also delicious with mini, adorable portions. Thats great, its really great . Whats different from other cafes is that you dont have to pay for parking when youre done, eits, but just be careful, bro, even though theres CCTV, we have to remain responsible for the vehicles you drive, theres also a confession spot ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha . Hopefully the cafe will continue because the place is okay, theres a prayer room too, the menu is okay, the service is okay, its not too busy but its not a quiet place thats scary, you know (you know what I mean) hihi hang out friendly, work friendly, wow, thats it, thats an enthusiastic review big sister Xier!!!!

My husband order nasi goreng buntut, but it came up with wierd taste.. we ask the waitress to check it, and its confirmed. They said sorry politely.. without any excuse So we ask to change the menu, after few moments the waiter (mas biltito) and manager (mas titan) came to us say sorry (again) and give little cake as complementary while waiting our food. We are so happy with this gesture.. its very professional yet sweet in the same time. Thank you Happy Day for make our late dinner become Happy Nite",1,1
