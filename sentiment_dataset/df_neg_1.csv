So on Sunday night, January 15 2022, around 8pm, my 3 friends and I went to look for dinner and we ended up at Angkringan Tajzu. There I and 3 of my friends got poor service. First, when I was choosing food, the lady in the middle was either braiding or tying the hair of the cashier, who was at the very end. Yes, personally I dont like it a bit, when the lady is on duty but doesnt pay attention to buyers like that. For example, explaining what kind of food there is, etc. Yes, as a form of intention to sell. Second. After I chose the food I wanted, at the cashier the lady was very friendly towards the buyers. Please also give change politely. Its true that the money wasnt thrown, but when Ms. gave him change it was like he slammed it on the table. The tone of speech has also been softened a bit, sis. Third. Miss in the middle, please dont be rude to buyers. Its a shame that the service is like that. Fourth. My friend experienced this incident and immediately told me about it when we were eating there. So 3 of my friends and I ordered food in pairs. Me and 1 of my friends went first, then 2 of my friends next. Well, my friend, lets say A, ordered 2 sweet iced teas (meant for A and my other friend B). Person A pays for food and sweet iced tea 1 (her own order). So, Ms. Cashier, when Ms. A was putting her food on our table, said my friend, Ms. B, the cashier said How about it, Sis, order 2 drinks and only pay for 1 right in front of Ms. B. Yes, Ms. B said that. Maam, thats one more for me. The point is, dont immediately judge buyers like that, because if we eat at the table there, we also have to pay for what we eat, right? The food is delicious, the place is also comfortable. Yesterday I bought Rica chicken rice and it tasted delicious. The spices are delicious, the portions are sufficient and the prices are affordable. And other foods such as meatball satay, chicken satay, cireng, fried meatball satay etc. are also delicious. As for the food, everything is delicious. Only the service is really lacking in my opinion. The ladies are still young too, they look like theyre in their 20s, but theyre just bitchy. Its a shame, the food is delicious and lots of choices, the place is comfortable, but unfortunately the service from the ladies is very lacking (in my opinion). Thank You",0,1.0

If youre not ready for a lot of bukber events and lots of orders, JUST do what you can. Dont accept everything but it turns out you CANT ACCEPT IT AND ITS JUSTIFY. First we called to make a reservation, we were able to accommodate indoors because we brought a baby. We will repeat via WhatsApp to request that the admin accept the indoor service. when we arrived it turned out our table was on the terrace. We complained to the admin via chat and they didnt get a response, then we went and were only answered if you dont want it, just cancel and the deposit will be returned (which turned out to be a template). We also asked the officer why we were on the terrace, the answer was that the terrace is also indoor. Then we asked again, According to her, do you think if you sit on the terrace, whether its outside or inside? he answered himself outside. If we respond, it means it doesnt match our request. and answered again with the template. At the start of the reservation, WA chat asks for a list of orders with 2 files, the bukber package and the regular menu. and asked for dp. When we received the deposit and sent the order, we were told that regular menu orders would only be processed at 7pm at the earliest. Logically, we order it to eat and eat at the same time as bukber. If it doesnt work, why is the regular menu included or why wasnt it announced earlier? the admin answered again according to the template. When we arrived the food was already served. We asked why the food had already been served even though the customer hadnt arrived yet, the worker who delivered it answered its like that here. Because our place was full so we just delivered it straight away - REALLY THIS WAS A hadeh ANSWER. Our extended family is also an FnB actor in a big city, we often eat at various restaurants where we order in advance, but NEVER ONE of the food is brought out before (at least) 1 representative of the customer who ordered has arrived. whats the reason like that? When I paid at the cashier, it turned out there were lots of people complaining too. there are those who have made a reservation but the menu doesnt come out, there are those who have made a reservation but its wrong and theyve complained that it wont be replaced immediately, etc. and the admins answer is the same: if its not appropriate from the start, you can cancel and the deposit will be returned. pie, how come the solution is like that? where every time we asked or complained to the officer, he didnt have a friendly face and his answers were curt. My family works in the hospitality sector, so we were surprised how come, we dared to open with a RESTO class title BUT the hospitality wasnt good. Oh yes, even the order we ordered was at that price, it seemed ordinary. the price for a package of bukber ribs is 60, but the meat is tough. The taste of the rujak seasoning is also like gule. the duck is also a lot. so its really not worth it. In other restaurants, ribs are the same price but they are tastier and more tender. so its worth it. The taste of iced tea is also inconsistent. I drank 3 glasses but the taste was all different. Even though the 2 were added after breaking the fast. The reasoning is that you can try it first if the worker is fasting. Is there really no consistent recipe here, I dont know.",0,1.0

There are several choices of space, indoor cafe, outdoor, co working space, and meeting room. For co-working space you have to pay 50k/12 hours/person to rent the space. The benefit is getting a heavy meal/drink worth 15-20k + snacks/packaged drinks worth 5-10k. Apart from that, you get WiFi access for 2 gadgets. For those who really need a private space, its really suitable. Because the space is more exclusive, not everyone can enter because there is a special access key. The room was also comfortable, the AC was cold, unfortunately the floor had a hole in the floor. BUT for those who dont really need a private room, its not recommended! Because of what? By paying 50k you only get the benefit of eating + drinking worth 25-30k and there is only wifi access for 2 gadgets. Maybe in other cafes you can have unlimited WiFi with lots of gadgets.

Otherwise, you can hit the jackpot  : ill-mannered passive-aggressive barrista. _ Service-Hospitality: 1/5 (if you can give 0.5, Ill give 0.5) When we arrived (Saturday, March 23 24 - 17.00), there were 2 barristas on standby: 1 man & 1 woman. The most problematic: the manners of the female barrista. First, the payment receipt was not provided by the person. to buyers. Then, because our order was quite large (2 packages of ONE + 1 dim sum), I asked if the tray could be borrowed (and would be returned immediately after placing the order on the table). But yes. CM answered, Nothing!, curtly. Even though at that time there was a tray on the cashiers counter carried by a male barrista. I dont have a problem with the self-service system, but trays should be provided so that buyers can carry large orders easily to their table. Apart from that, the SOP for opening and closing the cashier counter window for orders from the outdoor area is also quite annoying because of the barrista. opening and closing the sliding window with a loud stomp - I see in the review column there are already people complaining about this too. My friend & I were still standing in front of the cashiers counter to place an order, but yes. had closed the sliding window with a loud smack. Is it because of the barristas bad manners, or because of technical problems/the design of the window which is really hard when opening and closing? What is clear is that it gives the impression of being unfriendly and unprofessional. My friend & I immediately thought, I want to order a lot. The window has been opened, but its closed again. The desire to order disappeared instantly because of that. In my experience in designing F&B facilities (which are much higher-end than Kaneki), the walk thru ordering counter (outdoor ordering access) is always open, not opened and closed. To be consistent, it might as well be closed and you can only order from inside the room. My friend & I came in the afternoon at PKL. 17.00. Initially we sat in the outdoor area, at a corner table near the speakers, where the music was played at a standard volume so it didnt disturb our chatting activities too much. But now at street time. 19.30 I dont know why the speaker volume was turned up and it became quite annoying. Me & 2 of my friends thought, it wasnt us who were disturbed; This is the central area of the comp. residential area and its already night, but the sound of music is even louder, which in fact can disturb the peace of the local residents too. Then my friend took the initiative to go to the cashier counter, asking the barrista. so that the music volume is reduced to normal. After that the music volume was turned down, but only for a moment. When my friend returned to his seat, the music volume turned up again. Very unprofessional. Finally we decided to move to another table in Bag. front, near the entrance. But what was even more annoying was, after we moved tables, the music volume was turned down again. The barristas minus behavior. dont stop there. Around 10 p.m. 21.15, me & 2 of my friends are still chatting at the new table where we moved.

Food portions are relatively small compared to the price; the taste is also normal; coupled with the barristas very negative behavior. Not worth trying. _ Updates: After reading again, apparently there are a lot of reviews here that complain about the bad behavior of female barristas - and it seems like they are referring to the same barrista because of the same pattern of bad behavior. But it seems like the owner has no intention of responding to these complaints.

Indeed, several times past the front, there were indeed many buyers. but really, an honest review, this is my first impression of this place to eat, its a bit unpleasant and disappointing. It took a really long time for the food to arrive, more than 1.5 hours. Its been a long wait but to be fair, its okay, Ive been waiting a long time but the buyers who came after us were given priority, so whats the point of writing on the note? Thats it, what was cooked and what was ordered was wrong too. have to wait a long time. Its surprising, there are also some feelings from the employees. ordered nasgor, it just tasted ordinary, nothing special. 36 thousand spent, 50 thousand in cash, given 4 thousand back. pie to iki.

The service is very poor. I had to wait almost 10 minutes to order because there were no staff on duty at that time. Why can you leave the cashier counter empty when there are lots of people passing by? For a large cafe like PublicUs there must be at least 1 person standing guard at the front. This is different from other tenants such as Kalis, or several tenants on the 2nd floor, all of whom have at least 1 staff standing by behind their counter. 2. Serving food takes a long time. When you want to order food, there are only processed potatoes, even though its already far from opening hours, you should have prepared the ingredients. Actually, its not a big problem, really. The problem is why do you just order French fries and potato wedges and have to wait 30 minutes? Even though this process is easy and fast. Serving drinks is no problem, its good and fast. Hopefully it can be used as evaluation material for Publicus staff to improve services",0,1.0

In my opinion, the fish tastes very good, fresh and delicious. The serving is served with a choice of shrimp paste chili sauce or onion chili sauce as well as basil, cucumber and tomato salad. The chili paste is coarsely ground, and I think the taste of the chili paste is really delicious. Unfortunately, I was a bit surprised when I paid that it wasnt cheap like in other reviews on Google. 1 Grilled Pomfret Fish is priced at 60,000 for the conditions in the stall and is located in the Java area (Yogyakarta), in my opinion it is quite expensive.
