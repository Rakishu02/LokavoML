There are outdoor or indoor options here, besides that it is safe to bring children because it provides ample space to move around.

Because you know, its rich enough to just blend it like that. The sweetness is really good for me who doesnt like sweets, 9/10 I want to buy it again Ketupat ebi, this is what my sister likes. If you have a Sundanese tongue, God willing, you will like it. So delicious and spicy. I hate it so I cant give this one a rating Bakwan Pontianak, this is really delicious, 9.5/10 because its salty and umami together. Ive been eating bakwan for 5 years because I dont have any delicious bakwan, once Ive eaten something this good... Whats the name of this stuffed chicken? I forgot, oh the Coip is delicious, the chicken is dense, this is honestly better than the other tpt tpt Overall I like it Its not a free smoking area, the problem is, so just be patient if there is cigarette smoke Parking: Parking inside only fits 2 cars Yesterday I parked on the shoulder of the road about 50 meters from the restaurant Its okay, but if its raining, its homework too There is already a parking fee for 2k motorbikes 4k car It was put in a box when I left the restaurant",1,1

You could be given the opportunity to visit this place... unexpectedly at an altitude of +/- 1200 meters above sea level and at the very end, if you go up from the safari park gate there is a coffee which I think is very interesting to visit. At first it was just for fun browsing for dinner places around Seruni/Hobbit where my family was staying. Suddenly the name of this coffee appeared and we finally decided to accept the challenge of going up here... As a result we arrived at our destination... we werent sure about the map we were using but we still pushed up  . The right place at the wrong time in my opinion, because I arrived here at 8 pm, so the view really couldnt be seen because it was really dark the whole way up. Maybe in the afternoon I can enjoy the atmosphere here more, okay? But all of our journey was satisfied when we arrived here... the food was delicious, especially the fried banana... the rice bowl was delicious, the fried chicken was also delicious. The espresso was just as expected Plus the place is cool, comfortable, not stuffy... its really good for refreshing the brain... The service is also friendly. My advice is if you want to come here in the afternoon so you can really see the view... And dont forget that the car must be in good condition because the climb is quite good... its not scary, you just need to be extra careful and have a high driving experience (no beginner) especially if you go up at night. But overall, in my opinion, this coffee is really worth trying... I really recommend it ... Hopefully Asmaralaya coffee will continue to grow...",1,1

Judging from the location, it is not too far from Malioboro. Parking is quite spacious because it is on the top floor of the Cavinton Hotel It seems like every day there is a music release.

Its just that, last night when I ordered meltique steak, when it arrived at the table it was no longer very hot, both the meat and the side dishes. Only the taste and maturity level are perfect. Very delicious",1,1
